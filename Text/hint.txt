Hint 4.1
The second parameter to the input(...) statement prevents MATLAB from attempting to parse the data provided, returning a string instead. Without that activity suppressed, if you enter the string 'yes', MATLAB will rush off looking for a variable by that name.

Hint 5.1
If you experiment with this script a little, you will discover the power of vector processing for rapidly determining the sensitivity of results to different parameters. The mathematics may not work if you provide vectors for more than one of the given data items. However, vectors supplied for each of them in turn provide insight into the sensitivity of the results to each parameter.
