      <p>Although the matrix<a id="5283">!</a> operations<a id="5381">!</a> that are the subject of this chapter can be performed on pairs of vectors<a id="5437">!</a> or arrays that meet certain criteria, when using these operations<a id="5382">!</a>, we tend to refer to the data objects<a id="5374">!</a> as matrices<a id="5269">!</a>. In most mathematical discussions, the words "matrix<a id="5284">!</a>" and "array<a id="5154">!</a>" can be used interchangeably, and rightly so, because they store data in exactly the same form. Moreover, almost all of the operations<a id="5383">!</a> we can perform on an array<a id="5155">!</a> can also be performed on a matrix<a id="5285">!</a>—logical<a id="5257">!</a> operations<a id="5384">!</a>, concatenation<a id="5185">!</a>, slicing, and most of the arithmetic<a id="5152">!</a> operations<a id="5385">!</a> behave identically. The fact that some of the mathematical operations<a id="5386">!</a> are defined differently gives us a chance to think about an important concept that is usually well hidden within the MATLAB<a id="5261">!</a> language definition.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="chp-section" data-sect-num="1" data-sect-name="Concept: Behavioral Abstraction">
    <!-- Behavioral Abstration -->
    <h2 id="12_1">12.1	Concept: Behavioral Abstraction</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <p>Recall the following concepts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Abstraction</em> is the ability to ignore specific details and generalize the description of an entity</li>
            <li><em>Data abstraction</em> is the specific example of abstraction that we first considered whereby we could treat vectors<a id="5438">!</a> of data (and later other collections like structures and arrays) as single entities rather than enumerating their elements<a id="5200">!</a> individually</li>
            <li><em>Procedural abstraction</em> are functions that collect multiple operations<a id="5387">!</a> into a form; once they are developed, we can overlook the specific details and treat them as a "black<a id="5162">!</a> box," much as we treat built-in functions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Behavioral abstraction combines data and procedural abstraction<a id="5396">!</a>, encapsulating not only collections of data, but also the operations<a id="5388">!</a> that are legal to perform on that data. One might argue that this is a new, irrelevant concept best ignored until “we just have to!” However, consider the rules we have had to establish for<a id="5211">!</a> what we can and cannot do with data collections we have seen so far. For example, am I able to add two arrays together? Yes, but only if they have the same number of rows and columns, or if one of them is scalar<a id="5399">!</a>. Can I add two character<a id="5172">!</a> strings<a id="5426">!</a>? Almost the same answer, except that each string is first converted to a numerical<a id="5373">!</a> quantity and the result is a vector of numbers<a id="5370">!</a> and not a string. Can I add two cell<a id="5171">!</a> arrays? No.</p>
        <p>So at least some, and maybe all, data collections also "understand" the set of operations<a id="5389">!</a> that are permitted on the data. This encapsulation<a id="5203">!</a> of data and operations<a id="5390">!</a> is the essence of behavioral<a id="5160">!</a> abstraction. Therefore, we distinguish arrays from matrices<a id="5270">!</a> not by the data they collect, but by the operations<a id="5391">!</a> that are legal to perform on them.</p>

          <p>Previously, when we considered multiplying two arrays, we called this scalar<a id="5400">!</a> multiplication<a id="5351">!</a>, and it had the following typical array<a id="5156">!</a> operation<a id="5376">!</a> characteristics:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Either the two arrays must be the same size, or one of them must be scalar<a id="5401">!</a></li>
              <li>The multiplication<a id="5352">!</a> was indicated with the .* operator</li>
              <li>The result was an array<a id="5157">!</a> with the same size as the larger original array<a id="5158">!</a></li>
              <li>Each element of the result was the product of the corresponding elements<a id="5201">!</a> in the original two arrays</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This is best illustrated in Figure 12.1. Scalar division<a id="5188">!</a> and exponentiation have the same constraints.</p>
          <p>Matrix multiplication<a id="5353">!</a>, on the other hand, performed using the normal * operator, is an entirely different logical<a id="5258">!</a> operation<a id="5377">!</a>, as shown in Figure 12.2. The logical<a id="5259">!</a> characteristics of matrix<a id="5286">!</a> multiplication<a id="5354">!</a> are as follows:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>The two matrices<a id="5272">!</a> do not have to be the same size.</li>
              <ul>The requirements are either:
                  <li>One of the matrices<a id="5273">!</a> is a scalar<a id="5402">!</a>, in which case<a id="5164">!</a> the matrix<a id="5287">!</a> operation<a id="5378">!</a> reduces to a scalar<a id="5403">!</a> multiply.</li>
                  <li>The number of columns in the first matrix<a id="5288">!</a> must equal<a id="5207">!</a> the number of rows in the second. We refer to these as the <b>inner dimensions</b>. The result is a new matrix<a id="5289">!</a> with the column<a id="5176">!</a> count of the first matrix<a id="5290">!</a> and the row count of the second.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>If, as illustrated, <code>A</code> is an <code>m x n</code> matrix<a id="5291">!</a> and B is an <code>n x p</code> matrix<a id="5292">!</a>, the result of <code>A * B</code> is an <code>m x p</code> matrix<a id="5293">!</a>.</li>
              <li>The item at <code>(i, j)</code> in the result matrix<a id="5294">!</a> is the sum of the scalar<a id="5404">!</a> product of the <code>ith</code> row of <code>A</code> and the <code>jth</code> column<a id="5177">!</a> of <code>B</code>.</li>
              <li>Whereas with scalar<a id="5405">!</a> multiplication<a id="5355">!</a> <code>A .* B</code> gives the same result as <code>B .* A</code>, this is not the case<a id="5165">!</a> with matrix<a id="5295">!</a> multiplication<a id="5356">!</a>. In fact, if <code>A * B</code> works, <code>B * A</code> will not work unless both matrices<a id="5274">!</a> are square<a id="5421">!</a>, and even then the results are different. (Proof of this can be derived immediately from Figure 12.3 by eliminating the third row and column<a id="5178">!</a> and exchanging <code>a</code> for<a id="5212">!</a> <code>b</code>. All four terms of the result of <code>A * B</code> are different from <code>B * A</code>.)</li>
              <li>Whereas with scalar<a id="5406">!</a> multiplication<a id="5357">!</a> the original array<a id="5159">!</a> <code>A</code> can be recovered by dividing the result by <code>B</code>, this is not the case<a id="5166">!</a> with matrix<a id="5296">!</a> multiplication<a id="5358">!</a> unless both matrices<a id="5275">!</a> are square<a id="5422">!</a>.</li>
              <li>The <b>identity matrix<a id="5297">!</a></b>, sometimes given the symbol <code>I<sub>n</sub></code>, is a square<a id="5423">!</a> matrix<a id="5298">!</a> with <code>n</code> rows and <code>n</code> columns that is zero everywhere except on its major diagonal<a id="5186">!</a>, which contains the value<a id="5430">!</a> 1. In has the special property that when pre-multiplied by any matrix<a id="5299">!</a> <code>A</code> with <code>n</code> columns, or post-multiplied with any matrix<a id="5300">!</a> <code>A</code> with <code>n</code> rows, the result is <code>A</code>. We will need this property to derive matrix<a id="5301">!</a> division<a id="5189">!</a> below. (The built-in function<a id="5230">!</a> <code>eye(<a id="5208">!</a>...)</code> generates the identity matrix<a id="5302">!</a>.)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Figure 12.3 illustrates the mathematics for<a id="5213">!</a> the case<a id="5167">!</a> where a 3 x 2 matrix<a id="5303">!</a> is multiplied by a 2 x 3 matrix<a id="5304">!</a>, resulting in a 3 x 3 matrix<a id="5305">!</a>.</p>

      <div class="container">
          <p>Matrix division<a id="5190">!</a> is the logical<a id="5260">!</a> process of reversing the effects of a matrix<a id="5306">!</a> multiplication<a id="5359">!</a>. The goal is as follows: given <code>A<sub>nxn</sub></code>, <code>B<sub>nxp</sub></code>, and <code>C<sub>nxp</sub></code>, where <code>C = A * B</code>, we wish to define the mathematical equivalent of <code>C/A</code> that will result in <code>B</code>.</p>
          <p>Since <code>C = A * B</code>, we are actually searching<a id="5411">!</a> for<a id="5214">!</a> some matrix<a id="5307">!</a> Kn3n by which we can multiply each side of the above equation:</p>
          <p><code>K * C = K * A * B</code></p>
          <p>This multiplication<a id="5360">!</a> would accomplish the division<a id="5191">!</a> we desire if <code>K * A</code> were to result in <code>I<sub>n</sub></code>, the identity matrix<a id="5308">!</a>. If this were the case<a id="5168">!</a>, pre-multiplying <code>C</code> by <code></code> would result in <code>I<sub>n</sub> * B</code>, or simply <code>B</code> by the definition of <code>In</code> above. The matrix<a id="5309">!</a> <code>K</code> is referred to as the inverse of <code>A</code>, or <code>A<sup>-1</sup></code>. The algebra for<a id="5215">!</a> computing this inverse is messy but well defined. In fact, Gaussian Elimination to solve linear<a id="5249">!</a> simultaneous<a id="5413">!</a> equations accomplishes the same thing. The MATLAB<a id="5262">!</a> language defines both functions (<code>inv(<a id="5238">!</a>A)</code>) and operators<a id="5395">!</a> (“back divide,” \) that accomplish this.

          <ul>
              <li>This inverse does not exist for<a id="5216">!</a> all matrices<a id="5276">!</a>—if any two rows or columns of a matrix<a id="5310">!</a> are linearly related, the matrix<a id="5311">!</a> is <b><em>singular</em></b> and does not have an inverse</li>
              <li>Only non-singular, square<a id="5424">!</a> matrices<a id="5277">!</a> have an inverse (just as a set of linear<a id="5250">!</a> equations is soluble only if there are as many equations as there are unknown variables)</li>

          <p>The mathematics implementing rotation in two dimensions is relatively straightforward, as shown in Figure 12.4. If the original point location P is (x, y) and you wish to find the point P* (x*, y*) that is the result of rotating P by the angle &theta; about the origin of coordinates, the mathematics are as follows:</p>
          <p><code>x* = x cos&theta;  − y sin&theta;</code><br>
          <code>y* = x sin&theta;  + y cos&theta;</code></p>
          <p>which can be expressed as the matrix<a id="5322">!</a> equation:</p>
          <p><code>P* = A * P</code></p>
          <p>where A is found by:</p>
          <p>A = [cos&theta; −sin&theta;; sin&theta; cos&theta;]</p>
          <p>To rotate the x-y coordinates of a graphic object in the x-y plane about some point, P, other than the origin, you would do as follows:</p>
          <ol>
              <li>Translate the object so that P is at the origin by subtracting P from all the object’s coordinates</li>
              <li>Perform the rotation by multiplying each coordinate by the rotation matrix<a id="5323">!</a> shown above</li>
              <li>Translate the rotated object back to P by adding P to all the rotated coordinates</li>

      <div class="container clearfix">
          <p>The mathematics implementing rotation in three dimensions is a natural extension of the 2-D rotation case<a id="5169">!</a>. We present here a simple way to make this extension. The 2-D rotation in Section 12.4.1 that rotates by the angle &theta; in the x-y plane is actually rotating about the z-axis. If P* and P are now 3-D coordinates, we can rotate P by an angle &theta; about the z-axis with the equation:</p>
          <p><code>P* = R<sub>z</sub> * P</code></p>
          <p>where R<sub>z</sub> is computed as</p>
          <p><code>R<sub>z</sub> =	[cos&theta;, -sin&theta;, 0; sin&theta;, cos&theta;, 0; 0, 0 1]</code></p>
          <p>Similarly, we can develop matrices<a id="5279">!</a> R<sub>x</sub> and R<sub>y</sub> that rotate about the x and y axes by angles &phi; and &psi;, respectively.</p>
          <p><code>R<sub>x</sub> =	[1,	0, 0; 0, cos&phi;, -sin&phi;; 0, sin&phi;, cos&phi;]</code></p>
          <p><code>R<sub>y</sub> =	[cos&psi;, 0, sin&psi;; 0, 1, 0; -sin&psi;, 0, cos&psi;]</code></p>

          <p>An example of a script to rotate the solid cube drawn in Chapter 11 is shown in Listing 12.4. The major problem with rotating solid objects<a id="5375">!</a> is that the coordinates of the object are defined as arrays of points. However, the rotation matrices<a id="5280">!</a> need each set of coordinates in single rows. To accomplish this, we will use the <code>reshape(<a id="5397">!</a>...)</code> function<a id="5232">!</a> to transform the coordinates to and from the row vectors<a id="5439">!</a> necessary for<a id="5222">!</a> the coordinate rotation.</p>

          <p>A typical example of a simultaneous<a id="5416">!</a> equation problem might take the following form. Consider two straight lines on a plot with the following general form:</p>

          <p><code>A * V = c</code></p>
          <p>where <code>c</code> is the column<a id="5180">!</a> vector <code>[c1 c2]'</code> and <code>V</code> is the required result, the column<a id="5181">!</a> vector <code>[x y]'</code>. The solution is obtained by matrix<a id="5328">!</a> division<a id="5198">!</a> as follows:</p>

          <p>Industrial ceramics plants require mixtures with precise formulations in order to produce products of consistent quality. For example, a factory might require 100 kg of a mix consisting of 67% silica, 5% alumina, 2% calcium oxide, and 26% magnesium oxide. However, the raw material provided is not pure quantities of these materials. Rather, they are delivered as batches of material that consist of the required components in different proportions. Each batch of raw materials is analyzed to determine their composition, and we will need to do the analysis to determine the proportions of the raw materials to mix in order to accomplish the appropriate formulation. The raw materials we will use here are feldspar, diatomite, magnesite, and talc. Table 12.1 illustrates a typical analysis of the composition of these compounds.</p>

<li>Imagine that world leaders have decided to come up with a single
currency for<a id="5228">!</a> the world. This new currency, called the Eullar, is
defined by the following:<br>
Seven dollars and 3 Euros make 71 Eullars.<br>
One dollar and 2 Euros make 20 Eullars.<br>
You are a reputed economist, and your job is to find out the value<a id="5434">!</a> of
a dollar in terms of Eullars.</li>
<li>As an enthusiastic and motivated student, you decided to go
out and buy plenty of pens for<a id="5229">!</a> all your classes<a id="5174">!</a> this semester.
This spending spree unfortunately
occurred before you realized your
engineering<a id="5204">!</a> classes<a id="5175">!</a> seldom required the
use of "ink." So now, you're left with
four different types of pens and no
receipt—you only remember the total
amount you spent, and not the price of
each type of pen. You decide to get
together with three of your friends who<a id="5441">!</a>
coincidentally did the same thing as
you, buying the same four types of pens and knowing only
the total amount. Write a script to find the prices of each type
of pen.<br>
<b>Hint</b>: In order to find the price of each individual pen, you
could create a matrix<a id="5348">!</a> called "pens," where each
column<a id="5183">!</a> represents a different type of pen and each
row represents a different person and a column<a id="5184">!</a>
vector totals that contains the amount of money
each of you spent on the pens.
</li>
<li>Write a function<a id="5235">!</a> called rotateLine that takes in two vectors<a id="5440">!</a>, x and
y , of the same length that represent a set or ordered pairs that
could be used to plot a line. Your function<a id="5236">!</a> should also take in a
third parameter, theta , representing an angle in degrees. Your
function<a id="5237">!</a> should return xprime and yprime where xprime and yprime
represent the line that is x and y rotated about the origin by the
angle theta.<br>
For example:<br>
x = [ 7 7 11 11 7];<br>
y = [-5 -9 -9 -5 -5];<br>
[xprime yprime] = rotateLine(x, y, 90) returns:<br>
xprime = [5 9 9 5 5]<br>
yprime = [7 7 11 11 7]<br>
