      <p>The graphical techniques we have seen so far have been 2-D and 3-D plots<a id="5695">!</a>, whose basic concept is to write in places on the screen where data are required and to leave the rest of the screen blank. These presentations are easily generated when we have a mathematical model of the data and wish to represent it graphically. However, many sensors observing the world do not have that underlying model of the data. Rather, they passively generate 2-D repr that we see as images<a id="5614">!</a>, leaving the interpretation of those images<a id="5615">!</a> to an observer. This kind of presentation is exemplified by a digital photogra includes images<a id="5616">!</a> from many other sources like radar or X-ray machines.</p>
      <p>This chapter discusses some of the elementary processes that can be images<a id="5617">!</a> in order to begin to extract meaning from them.</p>

        </div>
         <p>Before we confine ourselves to practical, computational reality, we need to understand the general nature of an image. The easiest answer would be that an image is a 2-D sheet on which the color<a id="5484">!</a> at any point can have essentially infinite variability. However, since we live in a digital world, we will immediately confine ourselves to the conventional representation of images<a id="5618">!</a> required for<a id="5555">!</a> most digital display processors, as shown in Figure 13.1. We can represent any image as a 2-D, M x N array<a id="5442">!</a> of points usually referred to as picture elements<a id="5549">!</a>, or <b>pixels<a id="5683">!</a></b>, where M and N are the number of rows and columns, respectively. Each pixel is “painted” by blending variable<a id="5749">!</a> amounts of the three primary colors: red, green, and blue. (Notice that this is not the same blending process used in painting with oils or water colors, where the second primary color<a id="5485">!</a> is yellow and the combination process is reversed—increasing amounts of the primary colors tends toward black<a id="5471">!</a>, not white.)</p>
         <p>The resolution<a id="5697">!</a> of a picture is measured by the number of pixels<a id="5684">!</a> per unit of picture width and height. This governs the fuzziness of its appearance in print, and controls the maximum size of good-quality photo printing. The color<a id="5486">!</a> resolution<a id="5698">!</a> is measured by the number of bits<a id="5467">!</a> in the words containing the red, green, and blue (RGB) components. Since one value<a id="5737">!</a> generally exists for<a id="5556">!</a> each of the M x N pixels<a id="5685">!</a> in the array<a id="5443">!</a>, increasing the number of bits<a id="5468">!</a> for<a id="5557">!</a> each pixel color<a id="5487">!</a> will have a significant effect on the stored size of the image. Typically, 8 bits<a id="5469">!</a> (values 0–255) are assigned to each color<a id="5488">!</a>.</p>
         <p>The MATLAB<a id="5655">!</a> language has a data type,<a id="5736">!</a> <code>uint8</code>, which uses 8 bits<a id="5470">!</a> to store an unsigned integer in the range 0–255. It is unsigned because we are not interested in negative color<a id="5489">!</a> values, and to specify the sign value<a id="5738">!</a> would cost a data bit and reduce the resolution<a id="5699">!</a> of the data to 0–127. By combining the three color<a id="5490">!</a> values, there are actually 2<sup>24</sup> different combinations of color<a id="5491">!</a> available to a true-color<a id="5492">!</a> image—many more possible combinations than the human eye can distinguish.</p>

        <p>Our sources for<a id="5558">!</a> images<a id="5619">!</a> to process are data files captured by imaging devices such as cameras, scanners, and graphic arts systems, and these image files are provided in a wide variety of formats. According to the MATLAB<a id="5656">!</a> documentation<a id="5548">!</a>, it recognizes files in TIFF, PNG, HDF, BMP, JPEG (JPG), GIF, PCX, XWD, CUR, and ICO formats. The various file formats are usually identified by their file extensions. While this seems a bewildering collection<a id="5481">!</a> of formats, MATLAB<a id="5657">!</a> provides one image reading function<a id="5586">!</a> that converts these file formats to one of three internal representations: true color<a id="5493">!</a>, gray scale<a id="5704">!</a>, or color<a id="5494">!</a> mapped images<a id="5620">!</a>. In the MATLAB<a id="5658">!</a> implementation, we will confine our interests to two formats: .png files when absolute color<a id="5495">!</a> fidelity is required and .jpg files that offer better compression ratios to give a smaller file size for<a id="5559">!</a> a given image.</p>

           <p>True color<a id="5496">!</a> images<a id="5621">!</a> are stored according to the scheme shown in Figure 13.2 as an M*N*3 array<a id="5444">!</a> where every pixel is directly stored as <code>uint8</code> values in three layers of the 3-D array<a id="5445">!</a>. The first layer contains the red value<a id="5739">!</a>, the second layer the green value<a id="5740">!</a>, and the third layer the blue value<a id="5741">!</a>. The advantage of this approach, as the name suggests, is that every pixel can be represented as its true color<a id="5497">!</a> value<a id="5742">!</a> without compromise.

           <p>Color mapped, or indexed, images<a id="5623">!</a> keep a separate color<a id="5500">!</a> map either 256 items long (for maximum economy of memory) or up to 32,768 items long. Each item in the color<a id="5501">!</a> map contains the red, blue, and green values of a color<a id="5502">!</a>, respectively. As illustrated in Figure 13.3, the image itself is stored as an M x N array<a id="5447">!</a> of indices into the color<a id="5503">!</a> map. So, for<a id="5562">!</a> example, a certain pixel index might contain the value<a id="5745">!</a> 143. The color<a id="5504">!</a> to be shown at that pixel location would be the 143rd color<a id="5505">!</a> set (RGB) on the color<a id="5506">!</a> map.</p>
           <p>If the color<a id="5507">!</a> map is restricted to 256 colors, each pixel can be drawn at the same color<a id="5508">!</a> resolution<a id="5700">!</a> as a true color<a id="5509">!</a> image, as three 8-bit values, but the choice of colors is very restricted, and normal pictures of scenery—sky, for<a id="5563">!</a> instance—take on a “layered color<a id="5510">!</a>” appearance. Color mapped images<a id="5624">!</a> can be used effectively, however, to store “cartoon pictures” economically where limited color<a id="5511">!</a> choices are not a problem. Using a larger color<a id="5512">!</a> map provides a larger, but still sometimes restrictive, range of color<a id="5513">!</a> choices; but since the indices in the picture array<a id="5448">!</a> must be 16-bit values and the color<a id="5514">!</a> map is larger, the memory size advantages of this method of storage are diminished. Computationally, it is possible to convert a color<a id="5515">!</a> mapped image to true color<a id="5516">!</a>, but true color<a id="5517">!</a> or black<a id="5473">!</a>-and-white images<a id="5625">!</a> cannot normally be converted to color<a id="5518">!</a> mapped format<a id="5579">!</a> without loss of fidelity in the color<a id="5519">!</a> representation.</p>

           <p>In order to avoid confusion in the format<a id="5580">!</a> of images<a id="5626">!</a>, we will confine our discussions to one specific image file format<a id="5581">!</a> that is prevalent at the time of writing and that provides a nice compromise between economy of storage as an image file and accessibility within MATLAB<a id="5659">!</a>. We will discuss files compressed according to a standard algorithm originally proposed by the Joint<a id="5644">!</a> Photographic Experts Group (JPEG). When MATLAB<a id="5660">!</a> reads JPEG images<a id="5627">!</a>, they are decoded as true color<a id="5520">!</a> images<a id="5628">!</a>; when MATLAB<a id="5661">!</a> writes them, they are again encoded in compressed form. The file size for<a id="5564">!</a> a typical JPEG file is 30 times less<a id="5650">!</a> than the size you would need to store the M x N x 3 bytes of the image.

    <div class="container">
        <p>MATLAB<a id="5662">!</a> uses one image reading function<a id="5589">!</a>, <code>imread(...)</code>, for<a id="5565">!</a> all image file types. To read a file named <code>myPicture.jpg</code>, we use the following command:</p>
        <p><code>>> pic = imread('myPicture.jpg', 'jpg')</code></p>
        <p>where the result, <code>pic</code>, is an M x N x 3 <code>uint8</code> array<a id="5449">!</a> of pixel color<a id="5521">!</a> values, and the second parameter, <code>'jpg'</code>, provides the format<a id="5582">!</a> of the file explicitly. This parameter is optional; MATLAB<a id="5663">!</a> usually infers the file format<a id="5583">!</a> correctly from the file contents.</p>
        <p>Once the picture has been read, you can display it in a figure window with fixed size and axes visible by using the following command:</p>
        <p><code>>> image(<a id="5611">!</a>pic)</code></p>
        <p>This actually stretches or shrinks the image to fit the size of the normal plot figure, a behavior you normally desire; however, occasionally, you want the plot figure to match the actual image size (or at least, preserving its aspect ratio). Releases of MATLAB<a id="5664">!</a> after R2008a provide the <code>imshow(...)</code> function<a id="5590">!</a>, which presents the image without stretching<a id="5721">!</a>, shrinking<a id="5710">!</a>, or axes (unless the figure window is too small).</p>
        <p>Similarly, there is one function<a id="5591">!</a> for<a id="5566">!</a> writing files: <code>imwrite(...)</code>, which can be used to write most common file formats. If we have made some changes to pic, the internal representation of the image, we could write a new version to the disk by using the following:</p>
        <p><code>>> imwrite( pic, 'newPicture.jpg', 'jpg')</code></p>
        <p>where the third parameter, <code>'jpg'</code>, is required to specify the output format<a id="5584">!</a> of the file.</p>

           <p>In earlier chapters we have seen the basic ability to use index vectors<a id="5751">!</a> to extract rows and columns from an array<a id="5451">!</a>. Now we extend these ideas to understand how to uniformly shrink or stretch an array<a id="5452">!</a> to match an exact size. Consider, for<a id="5567">!</a> example, <code>A</code>, a <code>rows x cols</code> array<a id="5453">!</a>. Assume for<a id="5568">!</a> a moment that the vertical size is good, but we want to stretch or shrink the image horizontally to <code>newRows</code>—a number that might be larger or smaller than <code>rows</code>. We use <code>linspace(<a id="5652">!</a>...)</code> to create an index vector as follows:</p>
           <p><code>>> rowVector = linspace(<a id="5653">!</a>1, rows, newRows)</code></p>
           <p>where the third parameter is the desired size of the new array<a id="5454">!</a>. In general, this index vector will contain fractional values, but MATLAB<a id="5665">!</a> will truncate the index values. We can round the results as follows:</p>
           <p><code>>> rowVector = round(<a id="5703">!</a>rowVector)</code></p>
           <p>Then we can use this vector to shrink or stretch the picture pic as follows:</p>
           <p><code>>> newPic = pic(rowVector, cols, :)</code></p>
           <p>Clearly, this can be applied to both dimensions simultaneously, as shown in Exercise 13.1.</p>
           <span class="exercise">#exercise_13_1#</span>
           <p>In this exercise, first we read an image and determine its size. Note that with 3-D images<a id="5630">!</a>, you must give to the <code>size(<a id="5715">!</a>...)</code> function<a id="5592">!</a> three variables. Then we illustrate the “normal” slicing operations<a id="5680">!</a> by reducing the image to the even rows, and every third column<a id="5538">!</a>. Next, we generalize this image slicing by stretching<a id="5722">!</a> the number of rows by a factor 1.43 and shrinking<a id="5711">!</a> the number of columns by a factor 0.75. This is accomplished by building<a id="5478">!</a> a row index vector, <code>rowVec</code>, and a column<a id="5539">!</a> index vector, <code>colVec</code>, according to the algorithm above. The stretching<a id="5723">!</a> is achieved by repeating selected values in the index vector, and shrinking<a id="5712">!</a> is achieved by omitting some.</p>

           <p>As an example of image manipulation, consider the image shown in Figure 13.4. This is a 2400 x 1600 JPEG image that can be taken with any good digital camera. However, the appearance of the Vienna garden is somewhat marred by the fact that the sky is gray, not blue. Fortunately, we have a picture of a cottage, as shown in Figure 13.5, with a nice, clear<a id="5479">!</a> blue sky. So our goal is to replace the gray sky in the Vienna garden with the blue sky from the cottage picture.</p>

          </div>
           <p><b>Initial Exploration</b> Before we can do this, however, we need to explore the Vienna picture to determine how to distinguish the gray sky from the rest of the picture. In particular, there are patches of sky visible between the tree branches that must be changed as well as the open sky. Listing 13.1 illustrates a good way to accomplish this. Here we display the image in one figure; choose a representative row in the image that includes some sky showing through the tree (we chose row 350); and then plot the red, blue, and green values of the pixels<a id="5686">!</a> across that row. Figure 13.6 shows the resulting plot.</p>
           <p><b>Analysis</b> As we examine Figure 13.6, we see that the red, green, and blue values for<a id="5569">!</a> the open sky are all around 250 because the sky is almost white. However, the color<a id="5523">!</a> “spikes” that correspond to the color<a id="5524">!</a> values of the sky elements<a id="5550">!</a> that show through the tree are actually lower. We could decide, for<a id="5570">!</a> example, to define the sky as all those pixels<a id="5687">!</a> where the red, blue, and green values are all above a chosen threshold, and we could comfortably set that threshold at 160.</p>
           <div class="listing">#listing_13_1#</div>
           <p>There is one more important consideration. It would be unfortunate to turn the hair of the lady (the author’s wife) blue, and there are fountains and walkways that might also logically appear to be “sky.” We can prevent this embarrassment by limiting the color<a id="5525">!</a> replacement to the upper portion of the picture above row 700.</p>
           <p><b>Final Computation</b> So we are ready to create the code that will replace the gray sky with blue. The code in Listing 13.2 accomplishes this, and Figure 13.7 shows the resulting image.</p>

Furthermore, if we take a close<a id="5480">!</a> look at the wire (Figure 13.8), we see a number of disturbing things:</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>The sky is by no means uniform in color<a id="5526">!</a>—justifying the assertion that color<a id="5527">!</a> mapped images<a id="5631">!</a> do not have enough different colors to draw a true sky effectively</li>
                       <li>The color<a id="5528">!</a> of the wire is not far removed from the color<a id="5529">!</a> of some parts of the blue sky—so replacing slightly darker blue would be problematic</li>
                       <li>There is a light colored “halo” around the wire that is actually a result of the original JPEG compression of the image so that even if we did replace the darker colors, the “ghost” of the wire would still be visible</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>From this we conclude that pixel replacement will probably not solve our wire problem. We will take a different approach to solve this problem in Chapter 15.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Originally, a kaleidoscope<a id="5647">!</a> was a cardboard tube in which a number of mirrors were arranged in such a manner that one image—usually, a collection<a id="5482">!</a> of colored beads—was reflected to produce a symmetrical collection<a id="5483">!</a> of images<a id="5632">!</a>. We will replicate that general idea using MATLAB<a id="5666">!</a>. Figure 13.9 illustrates the geometric manipulation necessary to create one particular kaleidoscope<a id="5648">!</a> picture. We start with an arbitrary image and use shrinking<a id="5713">!</a> or stretching<a id="5724">!</a> to generate a square<a id="5719">!</a> picture—the ‘F’ in the figure. We then mirror it horizontally and concatenate it horizontally with the original image. We then mirror these two images<a id="5633">!</a> vertically and concatenate them vertically. Finally, we take that compound<a id="5543">!</a> image and repeat the process to produce the 4x4 image array<a id="5456">!</a> on the right side.</p>
          <p>Figure 13.10 shows the original image and the results. The overall logic<a id="5654">!</a> flow of the solution matches that shown in Figure 13.9.</p>
          <p>Listing 13.3 shows the code that makes the kaleidoscope<a id="5649">!</a>.</p>

              <p class="figure-name card-title">Figure 13.11: Map Projection</p>
          </div>
           <p>In Chapter 11 we saw how to create a surface<a id="5730">!</a> representing solid objects<a id="5675">!</a> and, in particular, how to create a spherical image that rotates with lighting.</p>
           <p>Spectacular effects can be created by “pasting” images<a id="5634">!</a> onto these surfaces, as will be illustrated in this last example. Here, we are given an image of the surface<a id="5731">!</a> of the earth using Mercator<a id="5672">!</a> projection, shown in Figure 13.11<sup><a style="color:black" href="#footnote">[1]</a></sup>. It is important to use the Mercator<a id="5673">!</a> projection, named for<a id="5573">!</a> the sixteenth-century Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator<a id="5674">!</a>, because this projection keeps the lines of latitude and longitude on a rectangular grid<a id="5609">!</a>. This allows a correct representation of the map as it is pasted onto the spherical surface<a id="5732">!</a>. However, it also presents a challenge because in this projection, the north and south poles would be stretched to infinite length across the top and bottom of the map. This map, therefore, leaves off the region near the poles, and we have to replace those regions.</p>
           <p>The objective of this exercise is to paste this image onto a rotating globe. The trick to accomplishing this is to use a feature of the <code>surf(<a id="5728">!</a>...)</code> function<a id="5594">!</a>, whereby the image is supplied in a specific form as the fourth parameter, as follows:</p>
           <p><code>surf(<a id="5729">!</a>xx, yy, zz, img)</code></p>

           </div>
           <p>It will replace the normal coloring scheme of the surface<a id="5733">!</a> with the image under the following conditions:</p>
           <uL>
               <li>The rows and columns of the image match the rows and columns of the <code>xx, yy, zz</code> plaid<a id="5691">!</a></li>
               <li>The image supplies the red, green, and blue layers in the same form as true color<a id="5530">!</a> images<a id="5635">!</a></li>
               <li>The color<a id="5531">!</a> values, however, must be of type double in the range <code>0..1</code></li>
           </ul>
           <p>In the following code, rather than stretching<a id="5725">!</a> the image to the size of the plaid<a id="5692">!</a>, we choose to size the plaid<a id="5693">!</a> to the image, thereby preserving all the image resolution<a id="5701">!</a>. Clearly, in different circumstances where the size of the plaid<a id="5694">!</a> is specified,  the  image  can  be  stretched  to suit those dimensions. The code to accomplish all this is shown in Listing 13.4.</p>

      </div>
        <p>While images<a id="5636">!</a> are powerful methods of delivering information to the human eye, they have limitations when being used by computer<a id="5544">!</a> programs. Our eyes have an astonishing ability to interpret the content of an image, such as the one shown in Figure 13.13. Even a novice observer would have no difficulty seeing that it is a picture of an aircraft in flight. An experienced observer would be able to identify the type of aircraft as a Lockheed C-130 and perhaps some other characteristics of the aircraft.</p>
        <p>While our eyes are excellent at interpreting images<a id="5637">!</a>, computer<a id="5545">!</a> programs need a lot of help<a id="5610">!</a>. One operation<a id="5677">!</a> commonly performed to reduce the complexity of an image is edge detection, in which the complete image is replaced by a very small number of points that mark the edges of "interesting artifacts." Figure 13.14 shows the results from a simple program attempting to paint the outline of the aircraft in black<a id="5474">!</a> by putting a black<a id="5475">!</a> pixel at an identified edge. The key element of the algorithm is the ability to determine unambiguously whether a pixel is part of the object of interest or not. An edge is then defined as a pixel where some of the surrounding pixels<a id="5688">!</a> are on the object and some are not. The image selected for<a id="5574">!</a> this exercise makes edge detection simple since the aircraft is everywhere darker than the surrounding sky.</p>

            <p class="figure-name card-title">Figure 13.15: Overlapping picture layers</p>
        </div>
        <p>The script used to generate this picture is shown in Listing 13.5. The basic approach of the algorithm is to use simple array<a id="5457">!</a> processing tools to detect the edges across the whole image at once. To accomplish this, we create four arrays, each one row and one column<a id="5540">!</a> less<a id="5651">!</a> than the original image and each offset by one pixel, as illustrated in Figure 13.15. The array<a id="5458">!</a> <code>pix</code> is in the original location, <code>pt</code> is one row up from that location, <code>pl</code> is one row left, and <code>ptl</code> is one row left and up. If we now collapse these arrays on top of each other, we are simultaneously comparing the values of a square<a id="5720">!</a> of four pixels<a id="5689">!</a> across the whole image (less one row and one column<a id="5541">!</a>).</p>
      </div>
        <div class="listing">#listing_13_5#</div>
        <p><b>Observation</b> Clearly, while<a id="5752">!</a> there is much more to be done with this data for<a id="5575">!</a> it to be useful, the complexity of this image has been reduced from 12 million <code>uint8</code> values with no real meaning to a small number of data values that outline an object of interest. Algorithms beyond the scope of this text<a id="5735">!</a> could be used to convert these outlining points to polynomial<a id="5696">!</a> shapes. These shapes could then be matched against projections of 3-D models to actually identify the object in the picture.</p>

          <li>The operator ____________ mirrors an array<a id="5460">!</a> about its ____________.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Programming Projects</h3>
<ol>
<li>As an introduction to image problems, perform the following
manipulations:
<ul>
<li>Find a suitable JPEG image file. Read it, display it, and store the
result in A.</li>
          <li>Create a copy of A, flip the image from left to right, and display it
in a new figure.</li>
          <li>Create a copy of A, swap the values for<a id="5578">!</a> red and blue, and display
it in a new figure.</li>
          <li>Create a copy of A, stretch the image to four times its original size
(twice as many rows and twice as many columns), and display it
in a new figure.</li>
          <li>Create a copy of A and then shrink the image to 0.7 its original
size in each dimension and display it in a new figure.</li>
</ul>
An image could be scrambled by doing the following in order:
<ol type="a">
<li>multiple quadrant flips:
<ol type="i">
<li>top left quadrant becomes bottom right quadrant</li>
          <li>top right quadrant becomes bottom left quadrant</li>
          <li>bottom right quadrant becomes top left quadrant</li>
          <li>bottom left quadrant becomes top right quadrant</li>
		  </ol>
          <li>The image is flipped upside down.</li>
          <li>The red values are swapped with the green values.</li>
          <li>The blue values are flipped left to right.</li>
		  </ol>
Write a function<a id="5598">!</a> called imageScrambler that takes in an image array<a id="5461">!</a>
and a string. If the string is equal<a id="5553">!</a> to 'scramble', your function<a id="5599">!</a>
should scramble the image according to the above method and
return the modified image in array<a id="5462">!</a> form. If the string is equal<a id="5554">!</a> to
'unscramble', your function<a id="5600">!</a> should unscramble the image by
reversing the above method and return the modified array<a id="5463">!</a>.
Otherwise, your function<a id="5601">!</a> should return the array<a id="5464">!</a> untouched. You
may assume that the image array<a id="5465">!</a> provided will always contain an
even number of rows and columns.<br>
Test your solution by writing a script that reads a selected image, A,
ensures that there is an even number of rows and columns, and tests
the scrambling and unscrambling the image.</li>
          <li>You are provided an image, and your job is to convert the full-sized
image to a smaller one. Normally when image processing software
is required to resize an image, a complex resizing algorithm is used
to accomplish the conversion. We will attempt to duplicate this
conversion. Write a function<a id="5602">!</a> called resizeMe that takes in a string as
an input corresponding to an image file name. The function<a id="5603">!</a> should
then resize the image to 1.414 times its original size in each
dimension and display it. Additionally, your function<a id="5604">!</a> should use
the built-in function<a id="5605">!</a> imwrite(...) to write the new image to a file.
The name of the new file will be the original file name preceded by
'LG' . For example, if the original filename is called 'yellow_bird.jpg', 
the new file should be called 'LGyellow_bird.jpg'.</li>
          <li>Write a function<a id="5606">!</a> called rotate that takes in an image array<a id="5466">!</a> and a
number. The number represents the number of times the function<a id="5607">!</a>
will rotate the image clockwise by 90 degrees. A negative number
signifies counter-clockwise rotation and a positive one signifies
clockwise rotation.</li>
          <li>We have obtained new intelligence that the Housing Department
has plans to renovate all the rooms in the dorms with a new
prototype. However, the prototype has been encoded into three
separate images<a id="5642">!</a> to avoid rival students finding out about it and
thus seeking refuge here. Each image only contains one layer of
color<a id="5535">!</a> (e.g., roomScrambledRed.jpg only contains the Red layer). As a
loyal student, it is your job to reconstruct a new image out of these
three images<a id="5643">!</a>.
<ol type="a">
<li>Create a script called room , and read the three layers using
'imread' . Create the new matrix<a id="5671">!</a> ReconImage with the three layers,
and display it using 'imshow'.</li>
          <li>After detailed analysis of the image, you find that it is also
scrambled. Using advanced crytography and whizbang
mathematical formulas, you have come to the conclusion that the
four quadrants of the image have been re-arranged. </li>
</ol>
Manipulate
the composite image from part a. and re-arrange the pieces to
form the proper image. Display it using subplot(<a id="5727">!</a>...) , below the
first image.</li>
          <li>For this exercise, you will visit - at least in MATLAB<a id="5669">!</a> - a place you
have always wanted to go.
<ol type="a">
<li>Find or take a picture of yourself with a plain background such
as a green screen, using the JPEG image format<a id="5585">!</a>. It would be a
good idea not to wear the color<a id="5536">!</a> of the background.</li>
          <li>Find a JPEG image of the place you want to go and decide on the
rectangle in that scene where your image should appear. Save the
width and height of the rectangle and the row and column<a id="5542">!</a> of its
top left corner.</li>
          <li>Re-size your image to be the width and height of the rectangle.</li>
          <li>Use the color<a id="5537">!</a> masking technique of section 13.4.2 to copy your
image without the green screen into the selected rectangle of
your dream scene.</li>
</ol>
          <li>Write a function<a id="5608">!</a> called
adjustImage that consumes the
name of an image file and an
angle in degrees and produces a
new image rotated counterclockwise
by that number of
degrees about the center of the
original image. Your new image
will be larger than the original
image.<br>
<b>Hint</b>: The trick to this is to move each pixel from its current
location (in polar coordinates, r - theta) to a new location on
the new image. The new location is found by adding the
rotation angle provided to the angular value<a id="5748">!</a>, u, of each pixel.
Those pixels<a id="5690">!</a> in the new image not occupied by a pixel will
be black<a id="5477">!</a>.</li>
