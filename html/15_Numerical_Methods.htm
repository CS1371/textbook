        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Real-world data are rarely in such a form that you can use it immediately. Frequently, the data must be manipulated according to the user's actual needs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the data samples have correct values but are not close enough together to be used directly, we can use interpolation to compute data points between the samples provided.</li>
            <li>There are occasions where the data-gathering facilities add some amount of noise to the data. To minimize the effects of the noise, we can compute the coefficients of a polynomial function that best matches the data.</li>
            <li>There are also times when the data must be integrated or differentiated to derive the quantities of interest.</li>
        </ul>

          </div>
          <p>If our data samples have correct values but are not close enough to be used directly, we can use either linear or cubic interpolation to compute data points between the samples provided. For example, plotting functions use linear interpolation to draw the lines between data points. In general, interpolation is a technique by which we estimate a variable's value between known values. In this section, we present the two most common types of interpolation: <b>linear interpolation</b> and <b>cubic spline interpolation</b>. In both techniques, we assume that we have a set of data points that represents x-y coordinates for which \(y\) is a function of \(x\); that is,</p>
          $$ y = f(x) $$
          <p>We then have a value of \(x\) that is not part of the data set for which we want to find the \(y\) value. Figure 15.1 illustrates the definition of the interpolation problem.</p>
        </div>


        <!-- Linear Interpolation -->
        <h3 id="15_1_1">15.1.1 Linear Interpolation</h3>
        <div class="container">
            <p>Linear interpolation is one of the most common techniques for estimating data values between two given data points. With this technique, we assume that the function between the points can be represented by a straight line drawn between the points, as shown in Figure 15.2.</p>
            <p>Since we can find the equation of a straight line defined by the two known points, we can find \(y\) for any value of \(x\). The closer the points are to each other, the more accurate our approximation is likely to be. Of course, we could use this equation to extrapolate points past our collected data. This is rarely wise, however, and often leads to significant errors. The function that performs linear interpolation is as follows:</p>
            <p><code>new_y = interpl(x, y, new_x)</code></p>
            <p>where the vectors <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> contain the original data values and the vector <code>new_x</code> contains the point(s) for which we want to compute interpolated <code>new_y</code> values. The <code>x</code> values should be in ascending order, and the <code>new_x</code> values should be within the range of the original <code>x</code> values. Note that the last character in the name <code>interpl</code> is the numeric 1 (one), not a lowercase L.</p>

            <p>The MATLAB language allows us to provide a fourth parameter to the interp1 function that must be a string that modifies its behavior. The choices are as follows:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                <li><code>'nearest'</code> nearest neighbor interpolation </li>
                <li><code>'1inear'</code> linear interpolationâ€”the default</li>
                <li><code>'spline'</code> piecewise cubic spline interpolation (see Section 15.1.2)</li>
                <li><code>'pchip'</code> shape-preserving piecewise cubic interpolation</li>
                <li><code>'cubic'</code> same as <code>'pchip'</code></li>
                <li><code>'v5cubic'</code> cubic interpolation that does not extrapolate, and uses <code>'spline'</code> if <code>x</code> is not equally spaced </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The MATLAB language also provides for two-dimensional (<code>interp2</code>) and three-dimensional (<code>interp3</code>) interpolation functions, which are not discussed here.</p>

        <!-- Cubic Spline Interpolation -->
        <h3 id="15_1_2">15.1.2	Cubic Spline Interpolation</h3>
        <div class="container">
          <p>A <b>cubic spline</b> is a smooth curve constructed to go through a set of points. The curve between each pair of  points is a third-degree polynomial that has the general form:</p>
          $$ {x = a_{x0}{t^3} + a_{x1}{t^2} + a_{x2}{t} + a_{x3}} and {y = a_{y0}{t^3} + a_{y1}{t^2} + a_{y2}{t} + a_{y3}} $$
          <p>where <code>t</code> is a parameter ranging from 0 to 1 between each pair of points. The coefficients are computed so that this provides a smooth curve between pairs of points and a smooth transition between the adjacent curves. Figure 15.4 shows a cubic spline smoothly connecting six points using a total of five different cubic equations.</p>
          <p>The function that performs linear interpolation is as follows:</p>
          <p><code>new_y = spline(x, y, new_x);</code></p>
          <p>where the vectors <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> contain the original data values, and the vector <code>x_new</code> contains the point(s) for which we want to compute interpolated <code>y_new</code> values. The <code>x</code> values should be in ascending order, and while the <code>x_new</code> values should be within the range of the <code>x</code> values, this function will attempt to extrapolate outside that range.</p>
          <p>The curve in Figure 15.4 was created using the code shown in Listing 15.2.</p>

            <p><b>Style Points 15.1:</b>
            <br>A good convention to adopt is shown in Figure 15.4:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use symbols to plot data points that are real values with no associated information connecting them.</li>
                <li>Draw lines between data points only when there is an analytic relationship that connects the data points.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here, we use a circle symbol for the raw data to emphasize the original source of the information, and a smooth line for the spline curve to indicate that we are assuming a possibly erroneous but continous relationship between data points.</p>

        <div class="container">
          <p>A note of caution about extrapolation - attempting to infer the values of data points outside the range of data provided is problematic at best and usually gives misleading results. Although logically your code may allow you to, you should never do it. The interp1 and spline functions behave differently in this respect. As we saw previously, the interp1 function refuses to supply results outside the range of the original <code>x</code> data. If you try, for every <code>new_x</code> value outside the range of the original <code>x</code> values, it will return <code>NaN</code> â€” not a number.</p>
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-8">
                  <p>This is actually quite nice because if you accidentally request interpolated data like this, the plot programs ignore <code>NaN</code> values. The spline function, however, has no such scruples and allows you to request any <code>x</code> values you want, using the equation of the closest line segment. So considering Figure 15.4, if you asked for the value at <code>x = -3</code>, it would use the segment between 0 and 1, which has a violent upswing at the lower end (see Exercise 15.1).</p>
                  <p>This might be what you want, but it looks odd! Chances are the data are not as accurate as you thought, and you probably need to fit a curve to the data, as explained in the following section.</p>

        <!-- Curve Fitting -->
        <h2 id="15_2">15.2 Curve Fitting</h2>
        <p>There are occasions where the data acquisition facilities add some amount of noise to the data. To minimize the effects of the noise, we can smooth the data by computing the coefficients of a polynomial function that best match the data. The choice of the order of the polynomial must be made by the users, depending upon their understanding of the underlying physics that generated the data.</p>
        <p>For example, assume that we have a set of data points collected from an experiment. After plotting the data points, we find that they generally fall in a straight line. However, if we were to try to draw a straight line through the points, probably only a couple of the points would fall exactly on the line. A least squares curve fitting method could be used to find the straight line that is the closest to the points, by minimizing the distance from each point to the straight line. Although this line can be considered a "best fit" to the data points, it is possible that none of the points would actually fall on the line of best fit. (Note that this method is different from interpolation, because the lines used in interpolation actually fall on all of the original data points.)</p>
        <p>In the following section, we will discuss fitting a straight line to a set of data points, and then we will discuss fitting a polynomial of higher order.</p>

                <p class="figure-name">Figure 15.5: An eyeball estimate of a linear fit</p>
            </div>
            <p>Linear regression is the process that determines the linear equation that is the best fit to a set of data points in terms of minimizing the sum of the squared distances between the line and the data points. To understand this process, first we consider the same set of data values used previously and attempt to "eyeball" a straight line through the data. Assume, for example, that \(y = 20x\) is a good estimate of the curve. Listing 15.3 shows the code to plot the points and this estimate.</p>
            <p>Looking at the results in Figure 15.5, it appears that \(y = 20x\) is a reasonable estimate of a line through the points.</p>
          </div>
            <div id="listing_15_3" class="listing">[Listing 15.3]</div>
            <p>We really need the ability to compare the quality of the fit of this line to other possible estimates, so we compute the difference between the actual y value and the value calculated from the estimate:</p>
            <p><code>>> dy = [0, 0, 20, 8, -3, 10]</code></p>
            <p>It turns out that the best way to make this comparison is by the <b>least squares technique</b>, whereby the measure of the quality of the fit is the sum of the squared differences between the actual data points and the linear estimates. This sum can be computed with the following command:</p>
            <p><code>>> sum_sq = sum(dy.^2)</code></p>
            <p>For the above set of data, the value of <code>sum_sq</code> is <code>573</code>. As we will see, MATLAB can automatically produce the best linear fit shown in Figure 15.6 whose sum of squares is <code>356.82</code>, a significant improvement over our original guess. This result was achieved by running Exercise 15.2.</p>`

        <!-- Polynomial Regression -->
        <h3 id="15_2_2">15.2.2	Polynomial Regression</h3>
        <div class="container">
            <p>Linear regression is a special case of the polynomial regression technique. Recall that a polynomial with one variable can be written by using the following formula:</p>
            $$ f(x) = a_0{x^n} + a_1{x^{n-1}} + a_2{x^{n-2}} + a_3{x^{n-3}} + ... a_{n-1}x + a_n $$
            <p>The degree of a polynomial is equal to the largest value used as an exponent. MATLAB provides a pair of functions to compute the coefficients of the best fit to a set of data and then interpolate on those coefficients to produce the data to plot:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>coef = polyfit(x, y, n)</code> computes the coefficients of the polynomial of degree <code>n</code> that best matches the given <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values. The function returns the coefficients, <code>coef</code>, in descending powers of <code>x</code>. For the least squares calculation to work, the length of <code>x</code> should be greater than <code>n - 1</code>. If this is not the case, the coefficients are still computed, but the curve passes through all the data points.</li>
                <li><code>new_y = polyval(coef, new_x)</code> can then be used to interpolate the polynomial defined by these coefficients for the <code>new_y</code> value(s) corresponding to any <code>new_x</code> value(s).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that there is nothing to prevent you from using these coefficients for extrapolation.</p>
            <p>Exercise 15.2 illustrates fitting the best straight line to the data used in Section 15.1.1, indicating that the first-order polynomial that best fits our data is as follows:</p>
            $$ f(x) = 20.8286x + 3.7169 $$
            <p>We could interpolate the values of new_x with: <code>new_y = coef(1) * new_x + coef(2)</code> or we could use the function polyval: <code>new_y = polyfit(coef, new_x)</code> </p>
            <p>We can use our new understanding of the <code>polyfit</code> and <code>polyval</code> functions to write a program to study the improvement in the curve fit as <code>n</code> increases, as shown in Listing 15.4.</p>
            <div id="listing_15_4" class="listing">[Listing 15.4]</div>
            <p>The results are shown in Figure 15.7. Notice that with six points, the fifth-order fit goes through all the data points.</p>

            <p>We return briefly to the problem of replacing the blue sky in Chapter 13. The sky we used to replace the gray skies of Vienna has a power line we need to remove. We can use polynomial curve fitting to create an artificial sky with exactly the same color characteristics as the blue sky in the cottage picture, but without the wire. This is possible because each row of the image has so much data that define its color profile that the presence of the wire is a minor amount of "noise." We merely need to process each row of the sky, fit a second-order curve to it, interpolate a new sky row from the parameters, and replace the row in the sky. The code to perform this is shown in Listing 15.5.</p>

            <p>Figure 15.8 shows the cottage picture updated with a smooth sky. Notice that the chimneys have been smeared off, but this does not affect the part of the sky needed for the Vienna picture. This synthetic sky is ready to be used in the script to replace the original sky (see Listing 13.1). Figure 15.9 shows the Vienna picture with a clear blue synthetic sky.</p>

            <p>The integral of a function \(f(x)\) over the interval \([a, b]\) is defined to be the area under the curve of \(f(x)\) between \(a\) and \(b\), as shown in Figure 15.10. If the value of this integral is \(K\), the notation to represent the integral of \(f(x)\) between \(a\) and \(b\) is as follows:</p>

        <p>Two of the most common numerical integration techniques estimate \(f(x)\) either with a set of piecewise linear functions or with a set of piecewise parabolic functions. If we use piecewise linear functions, we can compute the area of the trapezoids that compose the area under the piecewise linear function. This technique is called the <b>trapezoidal rule</b>.

        <div class="container">
            <p>We now consider a slightly different scenario. If \(f(t)\) is the rate of change of \(F(t)\) defined as \(f(t) = dF(t)/dt\), then given \(f(t)\), we can find the indefinite integral \(F(t)\) according to the following formula:</p>
            $$ F(t) = \int\limits_{t_0}^t f(x) dt $$
            <p>For example, we might be given data that represent the velocity of a sounding rocket, such as is plotted in Figure 15.12. We need to approximate the altitude of the rocket over time by integrating this data.</p>
            <p>To perform this kind of integral, the MATLAB language provides the function <code>F = cumsum(f)</code> that computes the cumulative sum of the vector <code>f</code>. The result, <code>F</code>, is a vector of the same length as <code>f</code> where <code>F(i)</code> is the sum of <code>f(1:i)</code>. If the data values, <code>f</code>, are regularly sampled at a rate <code>&Delta;t</code>, the integral is found by multiplying <code>cumsum(f)</code> by the time interval, <code>&Delta;t</code>. If they are not regularly sampled, you have to compute the <code>cumsum(...)</code> of the scalar product of <code>f</code> and the vector of time differences.</p>
            <p>To compute a more accurate integral, especially if the samples are not regularly spaced along the independent axis, MATLAB also provides the function <code>cumtrapz(t, f)</code> where <code>t</code> is the independent parameter and <code>f</code> the dependent parameter. The function uses trapezoidal integration to calculate the indefinite integral <code>F(t)</code>.</p>

        <!-- Numerical Differentiation -->
        <h2 id="15_4">15.4  Numerical Differentiation</h2>
        <p>The derivative of a function \(f(x)\) is defined to be a function \(f'(x)\) that is equal to the rate of change of \(f(x)\) with respect to \(x\). The derivative can be expressed as a ratio, with the change in \(f(x)\) indicated by \(df(x)\) and the change in \(x\) indicated by \(dx\), giving us the following:</p>
        $$ f'(x) = \frac{df(x)}{dx} $$
        <p>There are many physical processes for which we want to measure the rate of change of a variable. For example, velocity is the rate of change of position (as in meters per second), and acceleration is the rate of change of velocity (as in meters per second squared).</p> <p>The derivative \(f'(x)\) can be described graphically as the slope of the function \(f(x)\), which is defined to be the slope of the tangent line to the function at the specified point. Thus, the value of \(f'(x)\) at the point \(a\) is \(f'(a)\), and it is equal to the slope of the tangent line at the point \(a\).</p>


        <!-- Difference Expressions -->
        <h3 id="15_4_1">15.4.1	Difference Expressions</h3>
        <p>In general, numerical differentiation techniques estimate the derivative of a function at a point \(x_k\) by approximating the slope of the tangent line at \(x_k\) using values of the function at points near \(x_k\). The approximation of the slope of the tangent line can be done in several ways, as shown in Figure 15.14.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Backward Difference:</i> Figure 15.14(a) assumes that the derivative at \(x_k\) is estimated by computing the slope of the line between \(f(k_{x - 1})\) and \(f(x_k)\)</li>
            <li><i>Forward Difference:</i> Figure 15.14(b) assumes that the derivative at \(x_k\) is estimated by computing the slope of the line between \(f(x_k\) and \(f(x_{k + 1}\)</li>
            <li><i>Central Difference:</i> Figure 15.14(c) assumes that the derivative at \(x_k\) is estimated by computing the slope of the line between \(f(x_{k-1})\) and \(f(x_{k+1})\)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The quality of all of these types of derivative computations depends on the distance between the points used to estimate the derivative; the estimate of the derivative improves as the distance between the two points decreases.</p>

        <p>Since this is an analytical expression, even if some or all of the coefficients are complex, we can integrate it to estimate the integral of the raw data and differentiate it to estimate the slope of the raw data.</p>

              <p>As discussed in Chapter 14, we can synthesize the frequency content of an instrument by selecting an appropriate number of coefficients from the energy spectrum, multiplying each by an appropriate sine or cosine wave and summing the results. This gives a time trace with constant amplitude, which is fine for an instrument like a trumpet, but notes played on other instruments like a piano have a very non-linear time profile as shown in Figure 15.16. That same figure has two overlays indicating how to develop the decay profile typical of a piano note. First, we choose a modest number of samples that describe the envelope of the sound (marked by red * symbols). Then, we perform a high-order curve fit on that data and check its accuracy by plotting it as the solid line on the same figure.</p>
              <p>To demonstrate the essence of this capability, we begin with Listing 14.6 from Chapter 14, reading the file 'instr_piano.wav' instead of 'instr_tpt.wav.' Now, we insert the code in Listing 15.10 in place of the last two lines of Listing 14.6.</p>

            <div id="listing_15_10" class="listing">[Listing 15.10]</div>
            <p>In conclusion, with these two engineering examples, we have shown how the essence of the sound of a musical instrument can be derived from the actual sound of an instrument and captured as a small set of complex amplitudes with their frequency value and an even smaller set of real coefficients of the function that multiplies the amplitude over time.</p>
            <p>To construct from these data a real music synthesizer, one need only to detect that a keyboard note has been pressed, determine the required frequency, and play the synthesized note until the key is released. If the synthesizer is equipped to specify that the sustain pedal is depressed, the piano sound should not be cut off, but allowed to fade into silence.</p>
