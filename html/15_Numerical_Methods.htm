      <p>Real-world data<a id="7025">!</a> are rarely in such a form that you can use it immediately. Frequently, the data<a id="7026">!</a> must be manipulated according to the user's actual<a id="6952">!</a> needs:</p>

      <p>If our data<a id="7033">!</a> samples have correct values but are not close<a id="6969">!</a> enough to be used directly, we can use either linear<a id="7237">!</a> or cubic<a id="6980">!</a> interpolation<a id="7214">!</a> to compute data<a id="7034">!</a> points between the samples provided. For example, plotting functions use linear<a id="7238">!</a> interpolation<a id="7215">!</a> to draw the lines between data<a id="7035">!</a> points. In general, interpolation<a id="7216">!</a> is a technique by which we estimate a variable<a id="7363">!</a>'s value<a id="7335">!</a> between known values. In this section, we present the two most common types of interpolation<a id="7217">!</a>: <b>linear<a id="7239">!</a> interpolation<a id="7218">!</a></b> and <b>cubic<a id="6981">!</a> spline interpolation<a id="7219">!</a></b>. In both techniques, we assume that we have a set of data<a id="7036">!</a> points that represents x-y coordinates for<a id="7128">!</a> which \(y\) is a function<a id="7160">!</a> of \(x\); that is,</p>
      $$ y = f(x) $$
      <p>We then have a value<a id="7336">!</a> of \(x\) that is not part of the data<a id="7037">!</a> set for<a id="7129">!</a> which we want to find the \(y\) value<a id="7337">!</a>. Figure 15.1 illustrates the definition of the interpolation<a id="7220">!</a> problem.</p>

          <p>Linear interpolation<a id="7221">!</a> is one of the most common techniques for<a id="7130">!</a> estimating data<a id="7038">!</a> values between two given data<a id="7039">!</a> points. With this technique, we assume that the function<a id="7161">!</a> between the points can be represented by a straight line drawn between the points, as shown in Figure 15.2.</p>
          <p>Since we can find the equation of a straight line defined by the two known points, we can find \(y\) for<a id="7131">!</a> any value<a id="7338">!</a> of \(x\). The closer the points are to each other, the more accurate our approximation<a id="6956">!</a> is likely to be. Of course, we could use this equation to extrapolate points past our collected data<a id="7040">!</a>. This is rarely wise, however, and often leads to significant errors. The function<a id="7162">!</a> that performs linear<a id="7240">!</a> interpolation<a id="7222">!</a> is as follows:</p>
          <p><code>new_y = interpl(x, y, new_x)</code></p>
          <p>where the vectors<a id="7368">!</a> <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> contain the original data<a id="7041">!</a> values and the vector <code>new_x</code> contains the point(s) for<a id="7132">!</a> which we want to compute interpolated <code>new_y</code> values. The <code>x</code> values should be in ascending order, and the <code>new_x</code> values should be within the range of the original <code>x</code> values. Note that the last character<a id="6966">!</a> in the name <code>interpl</code> is the numeric 1 (one), not a lowercase L.</p>

          <p>The MATLAB<a id="7257">!</a> language allows us to provide a fourth parameter to the interp1 function<a id="7163">!</a> that must be a string that modifies its behavior. The choices are as follows:</p>

          <p>The MATLAB<a id="7258">!</a> language also provides for<a id="7133">!</a> two-dimensional (<code>interp2</code>) and three-dimensional (<code>interp3</code>) interpolation<a id="7228">!</a> functions, which are not discussed here.</p>

          <p>A <b>cubic<a id="6987">!</a> spline</b> is a smooth curve<a id="6998">!</a> constructed to go through a set of points. The curve<a id="6999">!</a> between each pair of  points is a third-degree polynomial<a id="7292">!</a> that has the general form:</p>
          $$ {x = a_{x0}{t^3} + a_{x1}{t^2} + a_{x2}{t} + a_{x3}} and {y = a_{y0}{t^3} + a_{y1}{t^2} + a_{y2}{t} + a_{y3}} $$
          <p>where <code>t</code> is a parameter ranging from 0 to 1 between each pair of points. The coefficients are computed so that this provides a smooth curve<a id="7000">!</a> between pairs of points and a smooth transition between the adjacent curves. Figure 15.4 shows a cubic<a id="6988">!</a> spline smoothly connecting six points using a total of five different cubic<a id="6989">!</a> equations.</p>
          <p>The function<a id="7164">!</a> that performs linear<a id="7242">!</a> interpolation<a id="7229">!</a> is as follows:</p>

        <p>A note of caution about extrapolation<a id="7125">!</a> - attempting to infer the values of data<a id="7048">!</a> points outside the range of data<a id="7049">!</a> provided is problematic at best and usually gives misleading results. Although logically your code<a id="6971">!</a> may allow you to, you should never do it. The interp1 and spline functions behave differently in this respect. As we saw previously, the interp1 function<a id="7166">!</a> refuses to supply results outside the range of the original <code>x</code> data<a id="7050">!</a>. If you try, for<a id="7137">!</a> every <code>new_x</code> value<a id="7339">!</a> outside the range of the original <code>x</code> values, it will return <code>NaN<a id="7271">!</a></code> - not a number.</p>
        <p>This is actually quite nice because if you accidentally request interpolated data<a id="7051">!</a> like this, the plot programs ignore <code>NaN<a id="7272">!</a></code> values. The spline function<a id="7167">!</a>, however, has no such scruples and allows you to request any <code>x</code> values you want, using the equation of the closest line segment. So considering Figure 15.4, if you asked for<a id="7138">!</a> the value<a id="7340">!</a> at <code>x = -3</code>, it would use the segment between 0 and 1, which has a violent upswing at the lower end<a id="7114">!</a> (see Exercise 15.1).</p>
        <p>This might be what you want, but it looks odd! Chances are the data<a id="7052">!</a> are not as accurate as you thought, and you probably need to fit a curve<a id="7003">!</a> to the data<a id="7053">!</a>, as explained in the following section.</p>

        <p>There are occasions where the data<a id="7054">!</a> acquisition facilities add some amount of noise to the data<a id="7055">!</a>. To minimize the effects of the noise, we can smooth the data<a id="7056">!</a> by computing the coefficients of a polynomial<a id="7293">!</a> function<a id="7168">!</a> that best match the data<a id="7057">!</a>. The choice of the order of the polynomial<a id="7294">!</a> must be made by the users, depending upon their understanding of the underlying physics that generated the data<a id="7058">!</a>.</p>
        <p>For example, assume that we have a set of data<a id="7059">!</a> points collected from an experiment. After plotting the data<a id="7060">!</a> points, we find that they generally fall in a straight line. However, if we were to try to draw a straight line through the points, probably only a couple of the points would fall exactly on the line. A least squares curve<a id="7004">!</a> fitting method could be used to find the straight line that is the closest to the points, by minimizing the distance from each point to the straight line. Although this line can be considered a "best fit" to the data<a id="7061">!</a> points, it is possible that none of the points would actually fall on the line of best fit. (Note that this method is different from interpolation<a id="7230">!</a>, because the lines used in interpolation<a id="7231">!</a> actually fall on all of the original data<a id="7062">!</a> points.)</p>
        <p>In the following section, we will discuss fitting a straight line to a set of data<a id="7063">!</a> points, and then we will discuss fitting a polynomial<a id="7295">!</a> of higher order.</p>

          <p>Linear regression is the process that determines the linear<a id="7244">!</a> equation that is the best fit to a set of data<a id="7064">!</a> points in terms of minimizing the sum of the squared distances between the line and the data<a id="7065">!</a> points. To understand this process, first we consider the same set of data<a id="7066">!</a> values used previously and attempt to "eyeball" a straight line through the data<a id="7067">!</a>. Assume, for<a id="7139">!</a> example, that \(y = 20x\) is a good estimate of the curve<a id="7005">!</a>. Listing 15.3 shows the code<a id="6972">!</a> to plot the points and this estimate.</p>
          <p>Looking at the results in Figure 15.5, it appears that \(y = 20x\) is a reasonable estimate of a line through the points.</p>
          <p>We really need the ability to compare the quality of the fit of this line to other possible estimates, so we compute the difference between the actual<a id="6953">!</a> y value<a id="7341">!</a> and the value<a id="7342">!</a> calculated from the estimate:</p>
          <p><code>>> dy = [0, 0, 20, 8, -3, 10]</code<a id="6973">!</a>></p>
          <p>It turns out that the best way to make this comparison is by the <b>least squares technique</b>, whereby the measure of the quality of the fit is the sum of the squared differences between the actual<a id="6954">!</a> data<a id="7068">!</a> points and the linear<a id="7245">!</a> estimates. This sum can be computed with the following command:</p>
          <p><code>>> sum_sq = sum(<a id="7328">!</a>dy.^2)</code<a id="6974">!</a>></p>
          <p>For the above set of data<a id="7069">!</a>, the value<a id="7343">!</a> of <code>sum_sq</code> is <code>573</code>. As we will see, MATLAB<a id="7259">!</a> can automatically produce the best linear<a id="7246">!</a> fit shown in Figure 15.6 whose sum of squares is <code>356.82</code>, a significant improvement over our original guess. This result was achieved by running Exercise 15.2.</p>

          <p>Linear regression is a special case<a id="6963">!</a> of the polynomial<a id="7296">!</a> regression technique. Recall that a polynomial<a id="7297">!</a> with one variable<a id="7364">!</a> can be written by using the following formula:</p>
          $$ f(x) = a_0{x^n} + a_1{x^{n-1}} + a_2{x^{n-2}} + a_3{x^{n-3}} + ... a_{n-1}x + a_n $$
          <p>The degree of a polynomial<a id="7298">!</a> is equal<a id="7120">!</a> to the largest value<a id="7344">!</a> used as an exponent.

        <p>As discussed in Chapter 14, we can synthesize the frequency content of an instrument by selecting an appropriate number of coefficients from the energy spectrum, multiplying each by an appropriate sine or cosine wave and summing the results. This gives a time trace with constant amplitude, which is fine for<a id="7150">!</a> an instrument like a trumpet, but notes played on other instruments like a piano have a very non-linear<a id="7250">!</a> time profile as shown in Figure 15.16. That same figure has two overlays indicating how to develop the decay profile typical of a piano note.

Then, we perform a high-order curve<a id="7014">!</a> fit on that data<a id="7084">!</a> and check its accuracy by plotting it as the solid line on the same figure.</p>
        <p>To demonstrate the essence of this capability, we begin with Listing 14.6 from Chapter 14, reading the file 'instr_piano.wav<a id="7375">!</a>' instead of 'instr_tpt.wav<a id="7376">!</a>.'

        <p>To construct from these data<a id="7085">!</a> a real music<a id="7269">!</a> synthesizer, one need only to detect that a keyboard note has been pressed, determine the required frequency,<a id="7158">!</a> and play the synthesized note until the key is released.

          <li>We can estimate data<a id="7086">!</a> points between given data<a id="7087">!</a> values using linear<a id="7251">!</a> <code>(interp1/2/3)</code> or spline interpolation<a id="7232">!</a></li>
          <li>We can smooth noisy data<a id="7088">!</a> by fitting polynomial<a id="7306">!</a> curves of suitable order to the raw data<a id="7089">!</a></li>
          <li>Given, for<a id="7151">!</a> example, the velocity of an object over time, we can determine its position by integrating using <code>cumtrapz(<a id="6997">!</a>...)</code> or <code>cumsum(<a id="6995">!</a>...)</code></li>
          <li>We can differentiate to generate its acceleration</li>
      </ul>

chapter:
<h3>True or False</h3>
<ol>
<li>All MATLAB<a id="7264">!</a> functions permit extrapolation<a id="7127">!</a> beyond the limits of
the original independent variable<a id="7366">!</a>.</li>
          <li>The cubic<a id="6990">!</a> spline is a series of parametric<a id="7283">!</a> curves.</li>
          <li>You cannot extrapolate the equations generated by curve<a id="7015">!</a> fitting.</li>
          <li>You should always match the order of a parametric<a id="7284">!</a> curve<a id="7016">!</a> fit to the

          <li>Simpsonâ€™s<a id="7321">!</a> rule is more accurate than the trapezoidal<a id="7332">!</a> rule for<a id="7152">!</a>
integrating a function<a id="7187">!</a>.</li>
          <li>Numerical differentiation<a id="7112">!</a> produces a vector that is the same length

</ol>

</ol>

<h3>Programming Projects</h3>
<ol>
<li>Do the following basic exercises with numerical<a id="7279">!</a> methods.
<ol type="a">
<li>Define two vectors<a id="7370">!</a> xi and yi of the same length where the xi
values are monotonically increasing and the yi values are
somehow related to the xi values. Then define a new vector x
with closer spacing than xi and extending below and above the
range of xi . Find the y values corresponding to the x values in xi
by linear<a id="7252">!</a> interpolation<a id="7233">!</a>. On the same figure, plot the original yi
vs. xi as red circles, and y vs. x as a black<a id="6961">!</a> line. What do you
observe about the visible range of the x values?</li>
          <li>Repeat the exercise in part a using the spline(<a id="7327">!</a>...) function<a id="7188">!</a> to
interpolate. Explain the difference in the range of the resulting y
vs. x plot.</li>
          <li>Use polyfit(<a id="7289">!</a>...) to find the coefficients of the third-order
polynomial<a id="7309">!</a> that best fits the points represented by vectors<a id="7371">!</a> xi and

yi and then use polyval(<a id="7317">!</a>...) to evaluate that curve<a id="7017">!</a> at the x points.
As before, plot yi vs. xi as red circles and y vs. x as a black<a id="6962">!</a> line.</li>
          <li>Approximate the derivative,<a id="7102">!</a> dxy = dy/dx, for<a id="7153">!</a> the vectors<a id="7372">!</a> xi and
yi using the diff(<a id="7107">!</a>...) function<a id="7189">!</a> and plot yi vs. xi . Since
diff(<a id="7108">!</a>...) reduces the length of the vector by one, you will have
to plot dxy vs. either xi(1:end<a id="7117">!</a>-1), xi(2:end<a id="7118">!</a>) or compute xm , the
mid-points of xi.</li>
          <li>Find yp, the cumulative sum of the elements<a id="7113">!</a> in dxy, and add this
to the plot of part d. With the exception of a constant offset, this
curve<a id="7018">!</a> ought to track the original plot of yi vs. xi.</li>
          <li>Use cumtrapz to find the area under the curve<a id="7019">!</a> represented by yp
vs. xi with the trapezoidal<a id="7333">!</a> method of approximation<a id="6959">!</a>. Compare
this result to the ending value<a id="7353">!</a> of the yp curve<a id="7020">!</a>.</li>
</ol>
          <li>Write a function<a id="7190">!</a>, bestFit, that takes in a vector of x-coordinates and
a vector of y-coordinates. Your function<a id="7191">!</a> should fit a polynomial<a id="7310">!</a>
curve<a id="7021">!</a> to the data<a id="7093">!</a>. The degree of the polynomial<a id="7311">!</a> should be the
smallest degree polynomial<a id="7312">!</a> with an average error (the average of
the absolute value<a id="7354">!</a> of the difference between the new y-coordinates
and the original y-coordinates) less<a id="7236">!</a> than 2. Your function<a id="7192">!</a> should
return:
<ol type="a">
<li>the vector of coefficients of your polynomial<a id="7313">!</a></li>
          <li>the vector of new y-coordinates, which is the polynomial<a id="7314">!</a>
evaluated at the original x-coordinates, and</li>
          <li>the vector of the error magnitudes of your polynomial<a id="7315">!</a>.
		  </ol>
Write a test program<a id="7319">!</a> to provide reasonable data<a id="7094">!</a> to your function<a id="7193">!</a>
and plot the original data<a id="7095">!</a> (in blue), the curve<a id="7022">!</a>-fitted data<a id="7096">!</a> (in green),
and the error (in red) on one figure. Title your plot and label your
axes accordingly, including a legend.</li>
          <li>You have been approached by the Rambling Wreck club to test the
performance of the Rambling Wreck. You are provided with the test
results of the car for<a id="7154">!</a> 10 trial runs in the form of a vector d that
contains the displacement of the car from the origin at that second.
The first element is the displacement at the 0th second, the second
element is the displacement at the 1st second, and so on. Write a
script called testWreck that displays a plot of the speed of the
Rambling Wreck over time during the test run. You could test your
script using:
d = [0 20 35 50 60 55 30 25 15 5];.</li>
          <li>Engineers often use tabulated data<a id="7097">!</a> for<a id="7155">!</a> various calculations. An
important method that any good engineer should be able to apply
to tabulated data<a id="7098">!</a> is interpolation<a id="7234">!</a>. In thermodynamics, the properties
of a gas can be known when two of its properties have been fixed.
You are required to come up with a continuous function<a id="7194">!</a> being given
the tabulated data<a id="7099">!</a> below measured where the pressure is 0.10 MPa:
<table>
<tr><th>Temperature (deg C)</th><th>Specific Volume (cu meters/Kg)</th></tr>
<tr><td>99.63</td><td>1.694</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>1.696</td></tr>
<tr><td>120</td><td>1.793</td></tr>
<tr><td>160</td><td>1.984</td></tr>
<tr><td>200</td><td>2.172</td></tr>
<tr><td>240</td><td>2.359</td></tr>
<tr><td>280</td><td>2.546</td></tr>
<tr><td>320</td><td>2.732</td></tr>
<tr><td>360</td><td>2.917</td></tr>
<tr><td>400</td><td>3.103</td></tr>
<tr><td>440</td><td>3.288</td></tr>
<tr><td>500</td><td>3.565</td></tr>
</table>
Write a function<a id="7195">!</a> called lookup that consumes three parameters<a id="7282">!</a>: the
above table in an array<a id="6960">!</a>, a number value<a id="7355">!</a>, and a logical<a id="7256">!</a> control value<a id="7356">!</a>
getTemp. If getTemp is true, the function<a id="7196">!</a> interpolates the value<a id="7357">!</a> as a
specific volume and returns the corresponding temperature.
Otherwise, it interpolates the value<a id="7358">!</a> as a temperature and returns the
corresponding specific volume.<br>
Your function<a id="7197">!</a> must not extrapolate the data<a id="7100">!</a> (i.e., it should return NaN<a id="7273">!</a> 
if the user tries to obtain values
outside the range of the table values).</li>
          <li>Mathematically speaking, a critical point occurs when the derivative
of a function<a id="7198">!</a> equals zero. It is possible that a local minimum<a id="7265">!</a> or a
local maximum occurs at a critical point. A local minimum<a id="7266">!</a> is a point
where the function<a id="7199">!</a>'s value<a id="7359">!</a> to the left and right of it is larger, and a
local maximum is a point where the function<a id="7200">!</a>'s value<a id="7360">!</a> to the left and
right of it is smaller. You are going to write a function<a id="7201">!</a> that finds the
local minimum<a id="7267">!</a> and maximum points of a set of data<a id="7101">!</a>. Call the
function<a id="7202">!</a> find_points . It should take in vectors<a id="7373">!</a> of x and y values and
return two vectors<a id="7374">!</a>. The first vector should contain the x values
where the minimum<a id="7268">!</a> points occur, while<a id="7378">!</a> the second vector should
contain the x values where the maximum points occur.<br>
For example:<br>
If x=linspace(<a id="7253">!</a>-8,2,1000) and y=x.^2+6*x+3;<br>
[min_p max_p]=find_points(x,y) should return<br>
min_p = -3, max_p = []<br>
If x=linspace(<a id="7254">!</a>-5,5,1000) and y=x.^3-12*x;<br>
[min_p max_p]=find_points(x,y) should return:<br>
min_p = 2, max_p = -2<br>
You should plot x and y to confirm the answers..</li>
          <li>Now that we used the derivative it only makes sense that you are
going to write a function<a id="7203">!</a> that finds integrals. Call your function<a id="7204">!</a>
find_integral . Your function<a id="7205">!</a> should take in a vector of x and y
values as Problem 15.5 does and should plot the integral and also
return the total area under the function<a id="7206">!</a>. You are to use the
trapezoidal<a id="7334">!</a> rule to find the integrals.<br>
For example:<br>
If x=linspace(<a id="7255">!</a>0,5,1000); and y=2*x+5;<br>
find_integral(x,y) should return 50.0000<br>
