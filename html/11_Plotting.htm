  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <p>There is a much-quoted expression that "a picture is worth a thousand words," and this is never more appropriate than when talking about data. In previous chapters, we used some simple plot commands to display data to illustrate its behavior. The capability of the MATLAB<a id="3774"></a> language to present data reaches far beyond ordinary data plotting, and far beyond the limited confines of a textbook. This chapter will present the fundamental concepts of the different forms in which data can be presented, but it leaves to the reader the challenge of exploring the full range of capabilities available. You only really discover the power inherent in the plotting capabilities of MATLAB<a id="3775"></a> when you have some unusual data to visualize.</p>

      <p>Before considering the details of how each plotting mode works, we should set the context. In this section, we will discuss the general container for all graphical types, the figure, and some basic operations<a id="3799"></a> that apply to all figures—functions that enhance them, the ability to assemble subplots into a single figure, and the advisability of making manual changes to plots<a id="3850"></a>.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <p>The fundamental container for plotting is a figure. In a simple script, if you just start plotting data, figure number 1 is automatically created to present the data. You can manage the figures by asserting the <code>figure</code> command. Each time figure is called, a new figure is made available, with the next higher figure number. If you use the form <code>figure &lt;number&gt;</code>, you can select a specific figure number for the next plot.  To clear<a id="3650"></a> the current figure, put the key word <code>clf<a id="3652"></a></code> in the header of your script. To remove all the figures, put the key phrase <code>close<a id="3653"></a> all</code> at the beginning of your script. The listing examples below will assume that each script begins with <code>clear<a id="3651"></a></code>, <code>clc<a id="3649"></a></code>, <code>close<a id="3654"></a> all</code>.</p>

      <h3 id="11_1_2">11.1.2	Simple Functions for Enhancing Plots</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <p>We have already introduced <code>plot(<a id="3833"></a>x, y)</code>, the basic function<a id="3684"></a> that creates a simple plot of <code>x</code> versus <code>y</code>. The following functions can be used to enhance any of the plots<a id="3851"></a> discussed in this chapter. Note that they enhance an existing plot; they should all be called after the fundamental function<a id="3685"></a> that creates a plot figure.</p>
         <ul>
           <li><code>axis &lt;param&gt;</code> provides a rich set of tools for managing the appearance of the axes, including the following:
            <ul>
              <li><code>tight</code> reduces the axes to their smallest possible size</li>
              <li><code>equal<a id="3680"></a></code> sets the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> scales to the same value<a id="3954"></a></li>
              <li><code>square<a id="3906"></a></code> makes the plot figure of equal<a id="3681"></a> width and height</li>
              <li><code>off</code> does not show the axes at all</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><code>axis(<a id="3635"></a>[xl xu yl yu zl zu])</code> overrides the automatic computation of the axis values, forcing the x-axis to reach from <code>xl</code> to <code>xu</code>, the y-axis from <code>yl</code> to <code>yu</code>, and the z-axis from <code>zl</code> to <code>zu</code>. For 2-D plots<a id="3852"></a>, the <code>z</code> values should be omitted.</li>
            <li><code>colormap &lt;specification&gt;</code> establishes a sequence of colors, the color<a id="3655"></a> map, to be used under a number of circumstances to cycle through a series of colors automatically. The legal specification values are listed in Appendix A.</li>
            <li><code>grid<a id="3730"></a> on</code> puts a grid<a id="3731"></a> on the plot; <code>grid<a id="3732"></a> off</code> (the default) removes grid<a id="3733"></a> lines.</li>
            <li><code>hold<a id="3758"></a> on</code> keeps the existing data on the current figure to allow the results of subsequent plotting calls to be added to the current figure without first erasing the existing plot; <code>hold<a id="3759"></a> off</code> (the default) allows you to redraw the current figure at the next plot call, erasing the previous contents.</li>
            <li><code>legend(...)</code> takes a cell array<a id="3632"></a> of strings, one for each of the multiple plots<a id="3853"></a> on a single figure, and creates a legend box. By default, that box appears in the top-right corner of the figure. However, this default can be overridden by explicitly specifying the location of the legend. See the help<a id="3734"></a> files for a complete discussion of the legend options.</li>
            <li><code>shading &lt;spec&gt;</code> defines the method for shading surfaces. See the help<a id="3735"></a> files for a complete discussion of the shading specification options.</li>
            <li><code>text(x, y, {z,}, str)</code> places the text<a id="3947"></a> provided at the specified (x, y) location on a 2-D plot, or at the (x, y, z) location on a 3-D plot.</li>
            <li><code>title(<a id="3953"></a>&lt;string&gt;)</code> places the text<a id="3948"></a> provided as the title of the current plot.</li>
            <li><code>view(<a id="3974"></a>az, el)</code> sets the angle from which to view a plot. The parameters are <code>az</code>, the azimuth, an angle measured in the horizontal plane, and <code>el</code>, the elevation, an angle measured upward from the x axis. Both angles are specified in degrees.</li>
            <li><code>xlabel(<a id="3977"></a>&lt;string&gt;)</code> sets the string provided as the label for the x-axis.</li>
            <li><code>ylabel(<a id="3978"></a>&lt;string&gt;)</code> sets the string provided as the label for the y-axis.</li>
            <li><code>zlabel(<a id="3979"></a>&lt;string&gt;)</code> sets the string provided as the label for the z-axis. (As we will soon see, all plots<a id="3854"></a> actually have a third axis.)</li>

          <p>Within the current figure, you can place multiple plots<a id="3855"></a> with the subplot command, as shown in Figure 11.1. The function<a id="3686"></a> <code>subplot(<a id="3910"></a>r, c, n)</code>divides the current figure into <code>r</code> rows and <code>c</code> columns of equally spaced plot areas, and then establishes the nth of these (counting across the rows first) as the current figure. You do not have to draw in all of the areas you specify. Figure 11.1 was generated by the code shown in Listing 11.1. Notice that the order of the plot positions is in an order different from that achieved when you linearize an array<a id="3633"></a>.</p>

        <p>When a figure has been created, you are free to manipulate many of its characteristics  by  using  its  menu items and tool bars. They provide the ability to resize the plot, change the view characteristics, and annotate it with legends, axis labels, lines, and text<a id="3949"></a> call-outs. However, <b><i>a word of caution</i></b> is in order here. It is very rare that you achieve what you desire on the first try.  Manual edits become very tedious and error prone when they must be repeated. You will always be better served by putting all that additions into your source code rather than ever using manual figure editing.  If for no other reason, by never using manual edits, you are avoiding the appearance of impropriety by being able to repeat any graphics you created from the source materials.</p>

        <p>The basic function<a id="3687"></a> to use for 2-D plots<a id="3857"></a> is <code>plot(<a id="3834"></a>...)</code>. The normal use of this function<a id="3688"></a> is to give it three parameters, <code>plot(<a id="3835"></a>x, y, str)</code>, where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are vectors of the same length containing the x and y coordinates respectively, and <code>str</code> is a string containing one or more optional line color<a id="3656"></a> and style control characters. A complete list of these control characters is included in Appendix A. If the vector <code>x</code> is omitted, MATLAB<a id="3776"></a> assumes that the x coordinates are <code>1:N</code>, where <code>N</code> is the length of the y vector. If the <code>str</code> is omitted, the default line is solid blue with no symbols at the data points. The MATLAB<a id="3777"></a> definition of this function<a id="3689"></a> also permits multiple <code>(x, y, str)</code> data sets in a single function<a id="3690"></a> call. It is always possible, of course, to produce the same result with multiple function<a id="3691"></a> calls in <code>hold<a id="3761"></a> on</code> mode.  Since we have already seen basic 2-D plotting at work, it should be sufficient to observe and comment on the simple example seen in Figure 11.2, generated by the code shown in Listing 11.2.</p>

        <p>Plotting is not restricted to the situation where the data along one axis are the  independent  variable<a id="3961"></a>  and  that along   the   other   are   dependent.

Consider the plot shown in Figure 11.3, which presents   a   simple   exercise   in transforming a circle into the shape of an airfoil, for example, the cross-section of an aircraft wing or a turbine blade.

      <p>Before attacking the details of plotting in three dimensions, it should be noted that even 2-D plots<a id="3861"></a> are actually 3-D plots<a id="3862"></a>. Consider the picture shown in Figure 11.3a, which was generated originally as the 2-D plot in Figure 11.3. By selecting the Rotate 3-D icon on the tool bar and moving the mouse on your figure, it becomes apparent that what appeared to be a 2-D plot in the x-y plane is really a 3-D plot in the x-y-z plane “suspended in space” at z = 0.</p>

The optional <code>str</code> specifies the color<a id="3659"></a> and/or line style. If the <code>str</code> is omitted, the default line is solid blue.  Figure 11.4 shows three curves plotted in three dimensions, using the script shown in Listing 11.4.

On the left side, the spiral is an example of a 3-D plot where two of the dimensions, x and y, are dependent on the third, independent parameter. The independent parameter in this example is the rotation angle, <code>theta</code>, varying from 0 to 10&pi; (five complete revolutions). The x and y values are mapped as sin(u) and cos(u) — the classic Polar to Cartesian conversion for describing a circle. The spiral effect is accomplished by plotting <code>theta</code> on the z-axis.  The right half of Figure 11.5 illustrates a fully parametric<a id="3804"></a> plot, where the values of all three coordinates are mappings of an independent parameter, <code>t</code>. This particular example is a plot of the 3-D Brownian motion of a particle receiving random impulses in all three axes. Note the use of text<a id="3950"></a> anchored in x-y-z space to label points on the graph. The figure is drawn using Listing 11.5.</p>

        <p>We will consider some simple situations that illustrate many of the features of surface<a id="3930"></a> drawing.</p>
        <p><b>Draw a cube</b>: In this example, in order to understand the underlying logic<a id="3767"></a>, we will develop the basic concept of drawing a cube without the help<a id="3745"></a> of the <code>meshgrid(<a id="3787"></a>...)</code> function<a id="3692"></a>. Figure 11.6 shows the coordinates of a cube of side 2 units centered at the origin drawn with simple line plots<a id="3869"></a> and Figure 11.7 shows the same cube drawn as a solid object. Before we descend into specifics, you need to understand specifically in the case<a id="3644"></a> of this cube how the <code>surf(<a id="3914"></a>...)</code> function<a id="3693"></a> works. Visualize four pens that can draw in 3-D space attached to the tops of your forefingers and thumbs respectively.Put your forefingers and thumbs together at the point P, and then slide them out to the points A, B, C and D. The <code>surf(<a id="3915"></a>...)</code>function<a id="3694"></a> fills in a surface<a id="3931"></a> between the lines you drew making the top of the cube. Now slide your fingers and thumbs down the sides of the cube to the points E, F, G and H. Filling in those surfaces draws the sides of the cube.  Finally, draw the bottom by sliding your fingers and thumbs across the bottom of the cube to its center at Q.</p>
        <p>To define the sides of the cube, we need to draw four lines to complete the horizontal square<a id="3907"></a>, thereby needing five columns with the first column repeated at the last column.  To define the top and bottom of the cube, we must add the points P and Q at the centers of the top and bottom. Although only one point each is required to define P and Q, the array<a id="3634"></a> must have the same number of columns in each row. Therefore, P and Q must be replicated five times to keep the arrays rectangular.</p>
        <p>Listing 11.6 shows the code that plots<a id="3870"></a> this cube from scratch.</p>

        </div>
        <p><b>A Simple Parabolic Dish</b>:  The simplest surface<a id="3932"></a> plots<a id="3871"></a> are obtained by defining a z value<a id="3955"></a> for each point on an x-y plaid<a id="3817"></a>. We will continue<a id="3664"></a> with a simple example illustrating the use of <code>meshgrid(<a id="3788"></a>...)</code> to define the plaid<a id="3818"></a>. Consider
        how we might plot the data shown in Figure 11.8 . Before we look at the code, consider what the picture represents. The independent variables are <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, each covering the range from −3 to 3, each having seven discrete<a id="3673"></a>
        values. As the title indicates, the <code>z</code> values are calculated as the sum of <code>x<sup>2</sup></code> and
        <code>y<sup>2</sup></code>. However, we don't need 14 <code>z</code> values as the range of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values might suggest, but <code>49</code>! In order to plot the 3-D shape of our parabolic<a id="3800"></a> bowl, we must have a <code>z</code> value<a id="3956"></a> for every point on the <code>x-y</code> surface<a id="3933"></a>. Each of these points has values of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> corresponding to the intersections of the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> vectors. Therefore, the process of creating this plot has three parts:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Develop the underlying plaid<a id="3819"></a> specifying the x-y location of every point on the x-y plane.</li>
          <li>Calculate the z values from the plaid<a id="3820"></a>.</li>
          <li>Call a plotting function<a id="3695"></a> that will accept the plaid<a id="3821"></a> and these z values to produce the required plot.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The code to accomplish this is shown in Listing 11.7.</p>

        <p><strong>Cylinder</strong>: Consider first the construction of a cylinder. One could consider this as a sheet of paper rolled up in a cylindrical shape. We could visualize that piece of paper as a plaid<a id="3822"></a> of values, not of <code>x-y</code>, but perhaps <code>x−&theta;</code> where the range of <code>x</code> would be from 0 to the length of the cylinder, and the range of <code>&theta;</code> would be <code>0</code> to <code>360°</code>.  To plot this, one would then merely need to create a plaid<a id="3823"></a> in <code>x</code> and <code>&theta;</code>, and then decide on the mapping<a id="3773"></a> from <code>x-&theta;</code> to the <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> values of the cylinder.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for us, however, the Matlab folks have provided a function<a id="3696"></a> named <code>cylinder</code> that takes two parameters: a vector or radius values along the length of the cylinder and the number of points around the circumference. We will see later how to generalize this, but for now, we use it in one line of code to compute the <code>xx</code>, <code>yy</code> and <code>zz</code> values that will draw a cylinder.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The cylinder and sphere<a id="3899"></a> drawn in the above section are special cases of a more general form of 3-D body. Bodies of rotation are created in general by rotating a function<a id="3698"></a> <code>v = f(u)</code> defined over a range of <code>u</code> values about the <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> or <code>z</code> axes.  In general, we make no claims about the nature of <code>f(u)</code>. It could be a rational function<a id="3699"></a>, or merely a “lookup table” specifying a value<a id="3957"></a> of <code>f(u)</code> for every <code>u</code>.  First, we consider rotating a continuous function<a id="3700"></a> <code>v = f(u)</code> about the x axis.</p>
        <p><strong>Using the <b><code>cylinder(<a id="3667"></a>...)</code></b> function<a id="3701"></a></strong>: To rotate <code>v = f(u)</code> about the x-axis, we could consider this equation as <code>r = f(x)</code>. Figure 11.11 shows the logic<a id="3768"></a> of this rotation. The independent variable<a id="3964"></a> is x, and the values of y and z are computed as the usual polar-to-Cartesian conversion:</p>
        <p><code>y = r cos(u)</code> and <br>
        <code>z = r sin(u)</code>.</p>
        <p>Whenever the rotation you want can be performed using the <code>cylinder(<a id="3668"></a>...)</code> function<a id="3702"></a>, you should do so, as is the case<a id="3645"></a> here. We want to put the independent variable<a id="3965"></a> <code>u</code> along the axis of rotation <code>x</code>  and make the dependent variable<a id="3966"></a> <code>v</code> the radius. The most general form of the <code>cylinder(<a id="3669"></a>...)</code> function<a id="3703"></a> allows you to specify a vector of radii equally spaced along the cylinder, which is the case<a id="3646"></a> here. Listing 11.9 shows how we do this, and Fig 11.12 is the result.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Generalized Bodies of Rotation</strong>: To rotate a shaping function<a id="3704"></a> <code>v = f(u)</code> about the z-axis requires some thought. Consider Fig 11.13. Although superficially similar to the X axis rotation in Figs 11.11 and 11.12 above, we need to exchange to roles of <code>u</code> and <code>v</code>. The independent variable<a id="3967"></a> <code>u</code> is now the radius of the shape and <code>v</code>, the dependent variable<a id="3968"></a>, needs to lie along the axis of rotation, z. There are several ways to accomplish this, and we will consider them in decreasing levels of 'horrible':</p>
        <ol>
          <li>We could invert the body of <code>f(u)</code> by changing it to <code>sqrt(u)</code>, but only the very simple functions are invertible like this</li>
          <li>As we will see later, Matlab has some useful tools that will look up equally spaced values of <code>v</code> and produce a new set of <code>u</code> values at those spacings, or</li>
          <li>we could give up on the <code>cylinder(<a id="3670"></a>...)</code> function<a id="3705"></a> and do the rotation from first principles.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We will implement this rotation using the third, most general strategy. Figure 11.13 shows the logic<a id="3769"></a> of this rotation. The independent variable<a id="3969"></a> is now <code>r</code>, and the values of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are computed as the usual polar-to-Cartesian conversion:</p>
        <p><code>x = r cos(u)</code> and <br>
        <code>y = r sin(u)</code>.</p>
        <p>You can see the results in Figure 11.14.  The code that generated this output is in Listing 11.10.</p>

        </div>
        <p><strong>More Complex shapes: a Torus (Donut)</strong>: A donut is actually very simple to draw from first principles.  We merely need to visualize what the cross-section looks like and then rotate it about the appropriate axis.  Clearly, the axis about which the final rotation is performed will be the Z axis so that the donut will be horizontal.  We therefore first visualize in the x-z plane what the section looks like.  In this case<a id="3647"></a>, it will be a circle offset from the origin of coordinates by a distance that will become the radius of the donut. That circle will be created using standard polar-to-Cartesian coordinates.  Finally, we realize that the plaid<a id="3824"></a> on which it will be built consists of two angles each going from 0 to 2&pi;.</p>
        <p>The code to accomplish this is in Listing 11.11, and the resulting image is in Figure 11.15.</p>

Shapes of considerable complexity can be assembled this way. Consider, for example, the Klein bottle shown below, a well-documented example of topological curiosity. The particular example shown in Figure 11.17. It was constructed by building<a id="3641"></a> a set of simple components and then concatenating the arrays. All the components could be created from the examples shown above. Moving from top to bottom, these components are:</p>
        <ul>

      <p>You have been given two files of data: "atlanta.txt", which presents the streets of Atlanta in graphical form, and "ttimes.txt", which gives the travel times between Atlanta suburbs and the city center. You have been asked to present these data sets in a manner that will help<a id="3756"></a> to visualize and validate the data.</p>

      <div class="container clearfix">
        <p>First, we proceed to determine the nature of the data by opening the files and examining their format and content.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Determine the file format</b>: the first step is to open the data files in a plain text<a id="3951"></a> editor. The format appears to be consistent with that of a text<a id="3952"></a> file delimited by tab characters. Since there are no strings in the files, it should be suitable to be read using the built-in <code>dlmread(<a id="3674"></a>...)</code> function<a id="3709"></a>. Of course, the down side of being able to read the files easily is that we have no idea what they contain, and we need to spend some quality time figuring that out.</li>
          <li><b>Discern the street map file content</b>: Table 11.1 shows the first few lines of the file &quot;atlanta.txt&quot; simplified by omitting certain irrelevant columns. The numbers<a id="3793"></a> in columns 2-5 are pairs, the first of the pair being a large negative number, and the second a smaller positive number. Assuming that each row of this file is a street segment, these could be the x-y coordinates of the ends of a line. A little thought confirms this guess when we realize that the latitude of Atlanta is around -84&deg; relative to the Greenwich meridian, and its longitude is around 33&deg; north of the equator - clearly, the values in these columns are 1,000,000 times the latitude and longitude of points within the city, probably each end<a id="3678"></a> of street segments. Column 6 contains numbers<a id="3794"></a> mostly in the range 1-6, which could indicate the type of street. We could explore this idea by coloring each line according to that value<a id="3958"></a>.</li>

          </div>
          <li><b>Discern the travel time file content</b>: Table 11.2 shows the first few lines of the file "ttimes.txt" simplified by omitting certain irrelevant columns. The same latitude/longitude values occur in columns 4 and 5, but they are not repeated, suggesting that the data in this file are in a different form. Examining the first two columns, the numbers<a id="3795"></a> in column 2 cycle repeatedly from 1 to 75, with column 1 counting the number of cycles<a id="3666"></a> up to 75. Furthermore, the values in column 5 are the same whenever column 1 is the same, and the values in column 4 are the same whenever the value<a id="3959"></a> in column 2 matches. This seems to be much like the plaid<a id="3826"></a> that results from a meshgrid(<a id="3789"></a>...) function<a id="3710"></a> call. The values in column 6 then become evident — they would be the z values of the plaid<a id="3827"></a>, and it seems reasonable to assume that they represent the travel time in minutes.</li>

  <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
  <div class="container">
    <p>This chapter presented the principles and practice of plotting:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic 2-D line plots<a id="3874"></a> are accomplished by using <code>plot(<a id="3837"></a>x,y)</code>, where <code>x</code> is the independent variable<a id="3970"></a> and <code>y</code> the dependent variable<a id="3971"></a></li>
      <li>2-D parametric<a id="3805"></a> plots<a id="3875"></a> are accomplished by using <code>plot(<a id="3838"></a>x,y)</code>, where both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are dependent on another independent variable<a id="3972"></a></li>
      <li>3-D line and parametric<a id="3806"></a> plots<a id="3876"></a> are accomplished by using <code>plot3(<a id="3842"></a>x,y,z)</code></li>
      <li>Basic 3-D surface<a id="3939"></a> plots<a id="3877"></a> are accomplished by building<a id="3642"></a> a plaid<a id="3828"></a> using <code>[xx yy] = meshgrid(<a id="3790"></a>x,y)</code>, computing the <code>zz</code> layer as a function<a id="3711"></a> of <code>xx</code> and <code>yy</code>, and then plotting the surface<a id="3940"></a> using <code>mesh(<a id="3782"></a>xx, yy, zz)</code> or <code>surf(<a id="3917"></a>xx, yy, zz)</code></li>
      <li>Parametric surface<a id="3941"></a> plots<a id="3878"></a>, like parametric<a id="3807"></a> line plots<a id="3879"></a>, are achieved by building<a id="3643"></a> the plaid<a id="3829"></a> with two independent variables and making <code>xx</code>, <code>yy</code>, and <code>zz</code> functions of those independent variables</li>
      <li>Bodies of rotation are a special case<a id="3648"></a> of parametric<a id="3808"></a> surface<a id="3942"></a> plots<a id="3880"></a> where one of the independent variables is an angle with values between <code>0</code> and <code>2&pi;</code>.</li>

Use the following questions to check your understanding of the material in this
chapter:
<h3>True or False</h3>
<ol>
<li>The plot(<a id="3839"></a>...) function<a id="3712"></a> needs only one parameter to function<a id="3713"></a>
correctly.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Programming Projects</h3>
<ol>
<li>Write a script that creates six sub-plots<a id="3885"></a> in two columns each with
three rows. Each plot should have an appropriate title and labels on
the x and y axes. The plot in the top left sub-plot should be<br>
 y = cos( u) for values of u from -2pi to 2pi.<br>
 Subsequent plots<a id="3886"></a> going across
the rows before going down the columns should be of <br>
y = cos(2 u ),
y = cos(3 u ), etc., to y = cos(6 u ) over the same range of u.</li>
<li>Your task is to create a script called thisPlot . This script should do
the following:
<ul>
<li>Ask the user to enter in a positive number, N, greater than 5.</li>
<li>Calculate the factorial for each number from 1 to N. Each of these
values should be stored into a vector.</li>
<li>Display a graph titled 'Logarithmic Growth', where the
logarithms for each of the factorials are displayed.</li>
<li>Add to the graph a continuous linear<a id="3765"></a> line that follows the
equation y = x with x values from 1 to N.</li>
<li>Since the numbers<a id="3796"></a> will have different magnitudes, use plotyy to
plot the linear<a id="3766"></a> values on the right hand axis.</li>
</li></ul>
<li>Write a function<a id="3717"></a> called sineGraph that graphs<a id="3728"></a> a sine function<a id="3718"></a> four
times between the interval [start,stop] on the same graph. The
start and stop values should be parameters of the function<a id="3719"></a>. The
number of points per interval will vary. More specifically:
<ul>
<li>The first time you graph the sine function<a id="3720"></a>, you should have two
evenly spaced points, start and stop</li>
<li>The next plot should have four evenly spaced points - start ,
stop, and two points between them</li>
<li>The third should have eight evenly spaced points and the fourth
256 points.</li>
<li>Make sure to add a legend and a title - 'Multiple graphs<a id="3729"></a> on one
plot'  - and to label the axes. Make sure that each line has a
different color<a id="3663"></a>.</li>
<li>The function<a id="3721"></a> should return the x and y values for the 256 point set.
Test your function<a id="3722"></a> with the following intervals [0, p /2] , [0,2 p ] ,
[0,4 p ] , [0,16 p ].</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This programming problem will compare the surf(<a id="3918"></a>...) and
mesh(<a id="3783"></a>...) functions by putting two 3-D side-by-side plots<a id="3887"></a> for
comparison using subplot(<a id="3912"></a>...) . You should label all axes
accordingly ( 'X-axis', 'Y-axis' , etc.) and title your plot
corresponding to the problem statement.
<ul>
<li>On the left side, plot the function<a id="3723"></a> f(x,y)=x^2*cos(y) in the range
x= -5:5 and y= -5:5 using mesh and name your plot 'Using Mesh'.</li>
<li>On the right side, plot the same function<a id="3724"></a>, in the same range, but
using surf . Name your plot 'Using Surf'.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Georgia Tech wants to tear down the Campanile and build a new
one that is ridiculously tall. However, before it is built, it needs you
to model it. Using the equation z = 1/(x^2 + y^2) as the model,
write a script that will plot the Campanile. Your domain should be
-.75 <= x <=.75 and -.75 <= y <= .75 using an increment of .05 for
each range. Set your axes such that all of the x, y domain is seen and
z runs from 0 to 300. Use surf(<a id="3919"></a>...) to plot your image.</li>
<li>You are provided the file 'data.csv', which contains two columns of
numbers<a id="3797"></a>. Each column contains the same number of elements. The
first row contains the titles of the x and y values, respectively. Create
a script called spreadSheetPlot that plots<a id="3888"></a> the data in this file. The first
column represents your x values, and the second column is your y
values. Read the numbers<a id="3798"></a> from the file and make a plot of the x vs. y
values. Title your plot 'spreadSheetPlot' and use the first row data to
label the x and y axes. For example, the spreadsheet might look like:</li></p>

<li>You just realized that February 14th has passed and you haven't
gotten anything for your Valentine. Since your date is a CS major,
sending the lucky person a coded heart seems like a cool and sincere
thing to do. Make sure that you follow each and every instruction
carefully, or your heart will end<a id="3679"></a> up broken. Trust us.
You are going to write a script to draw this heart using the
following steps:
<ul>
<li>Create a plaid<a id="3832"></a> [xx, yy] using x values with range (0 to 2p, with an
interval 0.05p) and y values with the range (0 to 1, with an
interval 0.05).</li>
<li>Define the following variables:
c=[0.1 + 0.9*(p-abs(xx - p))/p ] .* yy
aa = c .* cos(xx)
bb = c.* sin(xx)
zz = (-2)*aa.^3 + (3/2)*c.^2 + 0.5</li>
<li>Plot zz against aa and bb using the surf(<a id="3920"></a>) function<a id="3725"></a> with
interpolated colors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write a function<a id="3726"></a> named plotRotation that takes in two vectors, x
and z , and a vector th . Your function<a id="3727"></a> should plot three plots<a id="3889"></a> in the
same figure by using the subplot command. The figure should have
1 × 3 plots<a id="3890"></a>. The plots<a id="3891"></a> should be as follows:
<ul>
<li>z vs. x, titled 'z vs. x' . Note that you will have to use plot3(<a id="3843"></a>) to
correctly plot this in the x-z plane rather than the x-y plane a
plot(<a id="3840"></a>) would do. Also, you should use view(<a id="3975"></a>0, 0) to make the
plot produced by plot3(<a id="3844"></a>) show up as 2-D.</li>
<li>z vs. x rotated around the x-axis using mesh(<a id="3784"></a>) with flat shading
and a square<a id="3908"></a> axis, titled 'z vs. x about x using mesh'.</li>
<li>z vs. x rotated around the z-axis using surf(<a id="3921"></a>) with interp
shading and a square<a id="3909"></a> axis, titled 'z vs. x about z using surf' .
For plots<a id="3892"></a> b and c, the input vector th should be used for your
independent vector theta, which is used to convert from polar-to-
Cartesian coordinates. Don’t forget to title and label each of the
three plots<a id="3893"></a>.</li>
