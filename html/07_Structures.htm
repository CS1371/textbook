  <h2>Chapter Objectives</h2>
  <div class="container">
    <p>This chapter discusses the nature, implementation, and behavior of collections that may contain data items of any class, size, or shape. We will deal with two different <a id="2431"></a>heterogeneous storage mechanisms:
      <ul>
      <li>Those accessed by index (cell arrays) </li>
      <li>Those accessed by <a id="2347"></a><a id="2464"></a>field name (structures) </li>
      </ul>
    In addition, we will consider collecting <a id="2408"></a>structures into arrays of <a id="2409"></a>structures.</p>

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <div class="container">
     <p>This chapter covers data collections that are more general and flexible than the <b><a id="2440"></a>homogeneous</b> arrays we have considered so far. Conceptually, <b><a id="2432"></a>heterogeneous</b> collections may contain <a id="2457"></a>objects of any type, rather than just numbers. Consequently, none of the collective operations defined for numerical arrays can be applied to <a id="2283"></a><a id="2305"></a>cell arrays or <a id="2410"></a>structures. To perform most operations on their contents, the items must be extracted one at a time and replaced if necessary. We will consider three different mechanisms for <a id="2302"></a><a id="2321"></a><a id="2424"></a><a id="2460"></a>building <a id="2433"></a>heterogeneous collections:
     <ul>
     <li>you access components of a <b><a id="2284"></a>cell array</b> with a numerical index;</li>
     <li>you access components of a <b><a id="2496"></a>structure</b> with a symbolic <a id="2348"></a><a id="2465"></a>field name; and</li>
     <li>you access components of a <b><a id="2497"></a>structure array</b> by way of a numerical index to reach a specific <a id="2498"></a>structure then a symbolic <a id="2349"></a><a id="2466"></a>field name.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2 id="7_1">7.1	Concept: Collecting Dissimilar Objects</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <p>Heterogeneous collections permit <a id="2458"></a>objects of different data types to be grouped in a collection. They allow <a id="2329"></a>data abstraction to apply to a much broader range of content. However, the fact that the contents of these collections may be of any data type severely restricts the operations that can be performed on the collections as a whole. Whereas a significant number of arithmetic and logical operations can be performed on whole number arrays, algorithms that process <a id="2434"></a>heterogeneous collections almost always deal with the data contents one item at a time.</p>
      <p><b>Insignificant Footnote:</b> There is a fundamental aspect of computing that is carefully hidden by the Matlab but fully exposed in other languages especially Java. That aspect is this: computer languages that deal with complex concepts such as the subject of this chapter actually need to implement the <a id="2319"></a>classes that define behavior in a hierarchy.  At the root of that hierarchy in Java is a class called Object, and all Java <a id="2320"></a>classes actually respond as if they were Objects in addition to their specific behavior.  Matlab hides exactly the same behavior. Hence, while we discuss these collections as if they were <a id="2435"></a>heterogeneous, because of this hierarchy, the Matlab infrastructure treats them as <a id="2441"></a>homogeneous collections of Objects.</p>

      <p>Cell arrays, as the name suggests, have the general form of arrays and can be indexed numerically as arrays. However, each element of a <a id="2285"></a>cell array should be considered as a container in which one data object of any class can be stored. They can be treated as arrays of containers for the purpose of <a id="2294"></a><a id="2326"></a><a id="2519"></a>concatenation and <a id="2298"></a><a id="2487"></a><a id="2494"></a><a id="2523"></a>slicing. However, if you wish to access or modify the contents of the containers, the cells must be accessed individually.</p>
      <p><b>Nomenclature:</b> Cells and <a id="2286"></a><a id="2306"></a>cell arrays have dual meanings.  In one sense, the braces specify a <b><a id="2287"></a>cell</b>, a <b>container</b> of whatever is inside the braces. The other sense suggests that within the <a id="2288"></a>cell is an arbitrary <b>collection of <a id="2459"></a>objects</b> we will refer to as a <a id="2289"></a>cell's <b>contents</b>.</p>

      <h3 id="7_2_1">7.2.1	Creating Cell Arrays</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <p>Cell arrays may be constructed in the following ways:
        <ul>
          <li>By <a id="2516"></a>assigning values individually to a variable indexed with braces:<br>
          <code>>> A{1} = 42<br>
          A =<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[42] </li></code>
          <li>By <a id="2517"></a>assigning anything contained within braces individually to a variable normally indexed with parentheses:<br>
          <code>>> B(1) = {[4 6]};<br>
          B =<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[1x2 double] </code></li>
          <li>By <a id="2492"></a>concatenating <a id="2290"></a>cell contents using braces <code>{. . .}:<br>
          >> C = {3, [1,2,3], 'abcde'}<br>
          C = <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[3] [1x3 double] 'abcde'</li></code>
          <li>By <a id="2493"></a>concatenating <a id="2291"></a>cell containers:<br>
          <code>>> D = [A B C {'xyz'}]<br>
          D = <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[42] [1x2 double] [3] [1x3 double] 'abcde' 'xyz'</li> </code>
          </ul>
          <p>Based on these <a id="2427"></a>examples, we observe the following:
          <ul>
            <li>A <a id="2292"></a>cell array can contain any legal MATLAB object</li>
            <li>Just as with numerical arrays, <a id="2293"></a><a id="2307"></a>cell arrays can be created "on the fly" by <a id="2518"></a>assigning values to an indexed variable. </li>
            <li> When the values from a cell array are displayed, their appearance is different from that of the contents of a numerical array.
            <ul>
            <li>Individual numbers, vectors and arrays are shown in brackets, for example, <code>[1 2 3];</code></li>
            <li>larger numerical arrays display their size, for example, <code>[2&#215;3 double]</code>; and</li>
            <li><a id="2317"></a>character strings are displayed with the enclosing quotes, for example, <code>'abcde'</code>. </li>
          </ul></p>

      <!-- Accessing Cell Arrays -->
      <h3 id="7_2_2">7.2.2	Accessing Cell Arrays</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <p>Since <a id="2308"></a>cell arrays can be considered as conventional arrays of containers, the containers can be accessed and manipulated normally. For example, continuing the previous <a id="2428"></a>examples, we have the following:<br>
         <code>>> E = D(2) % parentheses - fetching a container<br>
        E = <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[4 6]</code></p>
        <p>However, braces are used to access the contents of the containers as follows:<br>
        <code>>> D{2} % braces - fetching the contents<br>
        ans =<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 6</code></p>
        <p>Exercise 7.1 shows details of cell indexing behavior.</p>
        <div class="exercise">#exercise_7_1#</div>
        <p><b>Lessons to learn:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>If the right-hand side of an <a id="2301"></a>assignment statement results in multiple <a id="2309"></a>cell arrays, the assignment must be to the same number of variables.</li>
          <li> The built-in function <code><a id="2330"></a><a id="2366"></a>deal(...)</code> is used to make these allocations.</li>
          <li>When we extract the contents of multiple cells using, for example,<code> A{1:2}</code>, this results in multiple assignments being made. </li>
          <li>These multiple assignments must go to separate variables. This is the fundamental mechanism behind <a id="2388"></a>returning multiple results from a function.</li>
          <li>These multiple assignments cannot be made to a single variable; sufficient storage must be provided either as a collection of variables or explicitly as a vector.</li>
          <li>Cell arrays can be "sliced" with normal vector indexing assignments as long as the sizes match on the left and right sides of the assignment. Any unassigned <a id="2300"></a>array elements are filled with an <a id="2343"></a>empty vector.</li>
          <li>The assignment <code>B{[1 3]} = A{[1 2]}</code> that produced an error needs some thought. Since <code>A{[1 2]}</code> produces two separate assignments, MATLAB will not assign the answers, even to the right number of places in another cell array.</li>
          <li> The <code><a id="2331"></a><a id="2367"></a>deal(...)</code> function is provided to capture these multiple results in different variables. Notice the difference between using <code>A{:}</code> and <code>A</code> as a parameter to <code><a id="2332"></a><a id="2368"></a>deal(...)</code>. When <code><a id="2333"></a><a id="2369"></a>deal(...)</code> is provided with a parameter other than a collection of cells, it merely copies that parameter to each variable.</li>
          <li>Assignments work normally if <a id="2310"></a>cell arrays are treated as vectors and the extraction of items can be indexed — <code>s</code> is a vector of the sums of the elements in <code>A</code>.</li>
          <li>When <a id="2508"></a>accessing <a id="2311"></a>cell arrays, it is normal to have braces on one side or the other of an assignment; it is rarely appropriate to have braces on both sides of an assignment. The result in the last example is that a container is loaded into the third container in the cell array.</li>

       <div class="template">#template_7_1#</div>
       <p>Checking the class of the element can be achieved in one of two ways:

         <li>The function <code><a id="2318"></a><a id="2365"></a>class(item)</code> returns a string specifying the item type that can be used in a switch statement</li>
         <li>Individual test functions can be used in an <code>if... <a id="2342"></a>elseif</code> construct; <a id="2430"></a>examples of the individual test functions are <code><a id="2379"></a><a id="2447"></a>isa(item, 'class')</code>, <code><a id="2380"></a><a id="2448"></a>iscell(...)</code>, <code><a id="2381"></a><a id="2449"></a>ischar(...)</code>, <code><a id="2384"></a><a id="2452"></a>islogical(...)</code>, <code><a id="2385"></a><a id="2453"></a>isnumeric(...)</code>, and <code><a id="2386"></a><a id="2454"></a>isstruct(...)</code>. </li>
       </ul></p>
       <p>For example, suppose you are provided with a cell array and have been asked for a function that finds the total length of all the vectors it contains. The function might look like that shown in Listing 7.2.</p>
       <div class="listing">#listing_07_2#</div>
       <p>MATLAB provides two functions that can cast data between a cell array containing only numbers, <code>ca</code>, and a numerical array, <code>arr</code>:<br>
        <code>arr = cell2num(ca) % consumes a cell array and returns a numerical array<br>

      </div>
     <p>Where <a id="2314"></a>cell arrays implemented the concept of <a id="2442"></a>homogeneous collections as indexed collections, a <a id="2499"></a>structure provides for items to be accessed by <a id="2350"></a><a id="2467"></a>field name rather than by indexing. Most modern languages implement the concept of a <a id="2500"></a>structure in a similar style. The data contained in a <a id="2501"></a>structure are referenced by <a id="2351"></a><a id="2468"></a>field name, for example, <code>item1</code>. The rules for making a <a id="2352"></a><a id="2469"></a>field name are the same as those for a variable. Fields of a <a id="2502"></a>structure, like the elements of a cell array, are <a id="2436"></a>heterogeneous — they can contain any MATLAB object. First, we will see how to construct and manipulate one <a id="2503"></a>structure, and then how to aggregate individual <a id="2411"></a>structures into an array of <a id="2412"></a>structures.</p>
   </div>

       <!-- Constructing and Accessing One Structure -->
      <h3 id="7_3_1">7.3.1	Constructing and Accessing One Structure</h3>
      <div class="container">
         <p>To set the value of items in a <a id="2504"></a>structure <code>A</code>, the syntax is as follows:<br>
        <code>&gt;&gt;  A.item1 = 'abcde'<br>
        A =<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item1: 'abcde'<br>
        &gt;&gt; A.item2 = 42<br>A =<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item1: 'abcde'<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item2: 42<br></code></p>
        <p>Notice that MATLAB displays the elements of an emerging <a id="2505"></a>structure by name. Fields in a <a id="2506"></a>structure are accessed in the same way &mdash; by using the <a id="2335"></a>dot notation.<br>
        <code>&gt;&gt; A.item2 = A.item2 ./ 2<br>
        A =<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item1: 'abcde'<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item2: 21<br>
        </code></p>
        <p>You can determine the names of the fields in a structure using the built-in function <code><a id="2358"></a><a id="2371"></a>fieldnames(...)</code>. It returns a cell array containing the <a id="2353"></a><a id="2470"></a>field names as strings.<br>
        <code>>> names = <a id="2359"></a><a id="2372"></a>fieldnames(A)<br>
        names = <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'item1' 'item2'<br></code></p>
        <p>Fields can also be accessed "indirectly" by setting a variable to the name of the <a id="2354"></a><a id="2471"></a>field, and then by using parentheses to indicate that the variable contents should be used as the <a id="2355"></a><a id="2472"></a>field name:<br>
        <code>>> fn = names{1};<br>
        >> A.(fn) = [A.(fn) 'fg']<br>
        A =<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item1: 'abcdefg'<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item2: 21</code></p>
        <div class="exercise">#exercise_7_2#</div>
        <p>You can also remove a <a id="2356"></a><a id="2473"></a>field from a structure using the built-in function <code><a id="2389"></a><a id="2477"></a>rmfield(...)</code>. Its specification is <code>function &lt;res&gt; = <a id="2390"></a><a id="2478"></a>rmfield(&lt;str&gt;, &lt;fld_name&gt;)</code>
        where <code>&lt;str&gt;</code> represents a structure consumed by the function
        <code>&lt;fld_name&gt;</code> represents a <a id="2357"></a><a id="2474"></a>field name and
        <code>&lt;res&gt;</code> represents a structure returned with the field removed.</p>
        <p>You must remember the scope rules for variables within a function. Code inside a function has no ability to "reach outside" that function to affect any changes at all to the workspace of the code that called the function. The only real problem here is the name of the function, <code><a id="2391"></a><a id="2479"></a>rmfield(...)</code>, which suggests that mystically, this function removes the field in <code>&lt;fld_name&gt;</code> from the structure <code>&lt;str&gt;</code> passed in. It probably should have been called <code>return_a_copy_of_the_structure_with_the_specified_field_removed(...)</code>!</p>
        <p>Exercise 7.2 gives you an opportunity to understand how to build <a id="2413"></a>structures. Here we build a typical structure that could be used as one entry in a telephone book. Since phone numbers usually contain punctuation, we could store them as strings. Notice that since a structure may contain any object, it is quite legal to make a structure containing a date and insert that structure in the date field of the entry. The structure display function, however, does not display the contents of the <a id="2414"></a>structures.</p>

      <!-- Constructor Functions -->
      <h3 id="7_3_2">7.3.2	Constructor Functions</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <p>This section discusses functions that assign their parameters to the fields of a structure and then return that structure. You do this, as opposed to "<a id="2475"></a>manually" entering data into <a id="2415"></a>structures, for the following reasons:
        <ul>
           <li>Manual entry can result in strange behavior due to <a id="2514"></a>typographical errors or having fields in the wrong order</li>
           <li>The resulting code is generally more compact and easier to understand</li>
           <li>When <a id="2507"></a>constructing collections of <a id="2416"></a>structures, it enforces consistency across the collections.
          </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>There are two approaches to the use of constructor functions: using built-in capabilities or <a id="2445"></a><a id="2513"></a>writing your own constructor.</p>
        <p><b>Built-in Constructor: </b> There is a built-in function, <code><a id="2401"></a>struct(...)</code>, that consumes pairs of entries, each consisting of a field name as a string and a cell array of field contents and produces a structure. If all the <a id="2315"></a>cell arrays have more than one entry, this actually creates a structure array, as discussed in Section 7.4.1.  The following command would construct the address book entry created in the previous section. Note the use of <a id="2339"></a>ellipses <code>(...)</code> to indicate to the MATLAB machinery that the logic is continued onto the next line.</p>
         <code>>><a id="2402"></a>struct('first','Fred', ...<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'last','Jones', ... <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'phone','(123) 555-1212', ...<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'birth', <a id="2403"></a>struct( 'day', 31, 'month', 'February', 'year', 1965 ))<br>
         ans = <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first: 'Fred'<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last: 'Jones'<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;phone: '(123) 555-1212'<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;birth: [1x1 struct]<br>
        </code> <br>
        <p><b>Custom Constructor:</b>The <code><a id="2404"></a>struct(...)</code> constructor is useful in general to create <a id="2417"></a>structures, but the need to repeat the field names makes this general-purpose approach a little annoying. We can create a special-purpose function that "knows" the necessary field names to create multiple <a id="2418"></a>structures in an organized way.  Listing 7.3 shows the code for a function that consumes parameters that describe a CD and assembles a structure containing those attributes by name.</p>
        <div class="listing">#listing_07_3#</div>
        <p>In Exercise 7.3, you can try your hand at using this function to construct a CD structure and then verify the structure contents.</p>

      <p>To be useful, collections like address books or CD collections require multiple structure entries with the same fields. This is accomplished by forming an array of data items, each of which contains the same fields of information.  MATLAB implements the concept of structure arrays with the properties described in the following paragraphs.</p>

        <p>Structure arrays can be created either by using MATLAB's <code><a id="2405"></a>struct(...)</code> function to build the whole structure array, or by using a custom function to create each individual structure.</p>
        <p>Built-in Constructor:</b> Listing 7.4 illustrates these concepts by implementing a collection of CDs as a structure array using the function <code><a id="2406"></a>struct(...)</code> from Listing 7.3.</p>
        <div class="listing">#listing_07_4#</div>
        <p>When using the built-in <code><a id="2407"></a>struct(...)</code> function to create a structure array, the form of the function call is identical to that used in Para 7.3.2. The only difference is the usage of the second parameter of each field_name/value pair. If the value is a cell array, the structure to be created becomes a structure array whose size (in the general sense) is the size of that cell array. Then, each field of the structure array receives the corresponding value from the cell array. If the field content is anything other than a cell array, the content of each structure array field becomes a copy of that item.  It is possible that the first field may not have a cell array as its value such as, for example, a last_name field. The first field whose value is a cell array will define the size of the structure array.  Subsequent fields may have the same size, but it is illegal for any subsequent fields to have cell array of a different size.</p>
        <p><b>Built-in Constructor:</b> Listing 7.5 illustrates these concepts by implementing a collection of CDs as a structure array using the function <code>makeCD(...)</code> from Listing 7.3.</p>

      <!-- Accessing Structure Elements -->
      <h3 id="7_4_2">7.4.2	Accessing Structure Elements</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <p>Like normal arrays or <a id="2316"></a>cell arrays, items can be stored and retrieved by their index in the array. As <a id="2419"></a>structures are added to the array, MATLAB <a id="2345"></a><a id="2364"></a>forces all elements in the structure array to implement the same field names in the same order, even if the inserted structure has the fields in the wrong order, or with some missing. Fields in the original structure not changed by the addition are filled with <a id="2344"></a>empty vector, <code>[]</code>. If you are trying to add a non-existent field, you should first add that field to the whole structure array before adding another structure containing that field.</p>
        <p>Elements can be accessed in three ways:
        <ul>
          <li>Individually
          <ul>
            <li>Manually (not recommended)</li>
            <li>Creating new structures with a constructor and adding them (recommended)</li>
          </ul>
          <li>By collectively <a id="2509"></a>accessing specific fields across the whole structure array</li>
        </ul><p>
        <p><b>Manually:</b> If you elect to manipulate the elements of a structure array <a id="2476"></a>manually, you merely identify the array element by indexing and use the <code>.field</code> operator. For example, for the CD collection <code>cds</code>, we could change the price of one of them as follows:<br>
        <code>>> cds(3).price = 11.95<br>
        cds = <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;1x3 struct array with fields:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;genre<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;artist<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stars<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;price<br></code></p>
        <p>This is a little hazardous when making manual additions to a structure array. A <a id="2515"></a>typographical error while entering a field name results in all the structures having that bad field name. For example, consider this error:<br>
        <code>>> cds(3).prce = 11.95<br>
        cds = <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;1x31 struct array with fields:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;genre<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;artist<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stars<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;price<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prce
        </code></p>
        <p>You have accidentally added a new field to the whole collection. You can check this by looking at one entry:<br>
        <code>>> cds(1)<br>
        ans = <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;struct with fields:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;genre: 'Blues'<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;artist: 'Sessions For Robert J'<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title: 'Clapton, Eric'<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year: 2004<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stars: 2<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;price: 18.95<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prce: []</code></p>
        <p>If this happens, you can use the <code><a id="2360"></a><a id="2373"></a>fieldnames(...)</code> function to determine the situation and then the <code><a id="2392"></a><a id="2480"></a>rmfield(...)</code> function to remove the offending entry.<br>
        <code>>> <a id="2361"></a><a id="2374"></a>fieldnames(cds)<br>

      </code></p>
      <p><b>Custom Constructor:</b> It is best to use the custom constructor to make a complete structure and then insert it into the structure array. For example:<br>
      <code>>> newCD = makeCD( 'Oldies', 'Greatest Hits', ... 'Ricky Nelson', 2005, 5, 15.79 );<br>
      >> cds = [cds  newCD]<br>
      cds =<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stars<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;price
      </code></p>
      <p>If you insert that new CD beyond the end of the array, as one might expect, MATLAB fills out the array with empty structures:<br>
      <code>>> cds(end+2) = newCD<br>
      cds =<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;1&#215;5 struct array with fields:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;genre<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;artist<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stars<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;price<br>
      <br>
      >> cds(end-1)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;genre []<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;artist []<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title []<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year []<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stars []<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;price []
      </code></p>
      <p><b>Accessing one field from the whole structure array</b>: Suppose we really want to extract, for example, all the prices from the cd array. Let's try the obvious way first:<br>
      <code>>> prices = cds.price;<br>
      prices =<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.9500
      </code></p>
      <p>Hmmm - seems to have given me just the first one.  How about letting <code>ans</code> have them all?<br>
      <code>>> cds.price;<br>
      ans =<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.9500<br>
      ans =<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.8900<br>
      ans =<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.4900<br>
      ans =<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[]<br>
      ans =<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.7900<br>
      </code></p>
      <p>That looks familiar - sending too many results (in this case, one result for each of the structures in the array) to the default variable.  See the beginning of Exercise 7.1 above. There, we solved the problem by providing at least one actual variable to capture a result, just as we did in our first try above. But what if we actually want all the values of a field? Since the number of structures is variable, we can't really provide the right number of variables to save all the results. So we use a different strategy: "catching" all the values in a collection of the appropriate type: a vector for fields containing only single numbers, a cell array for everything <a id="2340"></a>else. For example,<br>
      <code>
      >> [cds.price]<br>
      ans =<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.9500   14.8900   13.4900   15.7900<br>
      <font color="#00A000">% Be careful here - since the 4th structure has an empty vector for price,<br>
      %    it was ignored by the <a id="2295"></a><a id="2327"></a><a id="2520"></a>concatenation</font><br>

      <p><strong>Cell Array:</strong>  To access, for example, the year of the birthday of the third person in the Cell Array, you would need to:
      <ul>
        <li>figure out from some design document beyond the code itself which column contained the date structure and which row of the date structure contained the year.</li>

      <p>Many large bridges today have steel frames as their basic structure. Engineers perform the analysis and design work for each steel component and deliver these designs to the steel company. The steel company manufactures all the components, and prepares them for delivery to the <a id="2303"></a><a id="2322"></a><a id="2425"></a><a id="2461"></a>building site. At this point, each component is identified only by a unique identifier string stamped and/or chalked onto that component. For even a modest-sized bridge, this transportation may require a significant number of truckloads of components. The question we address here is how to decide the sequence in which the components are delivered to the <a id="2304"></a><a id="2323"></a><a id="2426"></a><a id="2462"></a>building site so that components are available when needed, but not piled up waiting to be used.</p>
      <p>Consider the relatively simple structure shown in Figure 7.3. The components have individual labels, and we can obtain from the architect the identities of the components that are connected together. The construction needs to start from the fixed point A. We need to analyze this information and compute the order in which the components would be used to assemble the structure.</p>
      <p>The data will be organized as a structure array with one entry for each component. One of the fields in that structure will be a cell array of the names of the components to which this component is connected.</p>
      <p>The code in Listing 7.6 shows the solution to this problem. When you run this, the output should be:<br>
        <code>group 1 = { A B E F }<br>
        group 2 = { C G }<br>
        group 3 = { D }<br>
        Beams should arrive in this order:<br>
        E-A E-B E-F A-B B-F F-C F-G B-C C-G G-D C-D<br></code></p>
      <p>Although this seems to be simple problem, there is not a natural ordering of the components.  The goal of algorithm cited within the listing is to identify small groups of components that do have natural ordering and then schedule the beams that make up each group for delivery.</p>

  <!-- Chapter Summary -->
  <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
  <p>This chapter covered the nature, implementation, and behavior of two <a id="2437"></a>heterogeneous collections:
  <ul>
    <li>Cell arrays are vectors of containers; their elements can be manipulated either as vectors of containers, or individually by <a id="2297"></a><a id="2324"></a><a id="2446"></a><a id="2463"></a><a id="2510"></a><a id="2522"></a>inserting or extracting the contents of the container using braces in place of parentheses</li>
    <li>The elements of a structure are accessed directly by name rather than by indexing, using the <a id="2338"></a>dot operator, '.', to specify the field name to be used</li>
    <li>The elements of a structure can also be accessed indirectly using the contents of a variable as the field name. If we have a structure array <code>sa</code> and the variable <code>my_field</code> contains <code>'fn'</code>, we access the field 'fn' in sa with 'sa.(my_field)'.</li>
    <li>Structures can be collected into structure arrays whose elements are structures all with the same field names. These elements can then be indexed and manipulated in the same manner as the cells in a cell array</li>
  </ul></p>

For example,<br>
[a b c d e f] = cellParse( { [1 2 3], true, 'hi there!', 42, false, 'abc'} ) <br>
should return<br>
 a = 2, b = 2, c = 2, d = {'abc','hi there!},
e = 2, and f = false.</li>
<li>It turns out that since you have become an expert on rating clothing
( Chapter 4 , Problem 5), Acme Clothing Company has hired you to
rate its clothes. Clothes are now represented as structures instead of
vectors with the fields (all of which are numbers between 0 and 5):
Condition, Color, Price, Matches, and Comfort
Acme has a much simpler way of rating its clothes than you used
before:<br>
Rating = 5 * Condition + 3 * Color + 2 * Price + Matches
+ 9 * Comfort<br>
You have a script called makeClothes.m that will create a structure
array called acmeClothes that contains clothes structures. You are to
write a script called rateClothes that will add a Rating field and a
Quality field to each of the structures in the acmeClothes array. The
Rating field in each structure should contain the rating of that
particular article of clothing. The Quality field is a string that is
'premium' if the Rating is over 80, 'good' over 60, 'poor' over 20,
and 'liquidated' for anything <a id="2341"></a>else.<br>
Note:<br>
<ul>
<li>You MUST use iteration to solve this problem.</li>
<li>To make things easy, just place the line makeClothes at the top of
your script, so you're guaranteed to have the correct acmeClothes
array to work with.</li>
<li>The fields are case sensitive, so make sure that you capitalize them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You have been hired by a used-car dealership to modify the price of
cars that are up for sale. You will get the information about a car,
and then change its price tag depending on a number of factors.
Write a function called usedCar that takes in a structure with the
following fields:<br>
Make: A string that represents the make of the car (e.g., 'Toyota
Corolla' )<br>
Year: A number that corresponds to the year of the car (e.g., 1997 )<br>
Cost : A number that holds the marked price of the car (e.g., 7,000 )<br>
Miles : The number of miles clocked (e.g., 85,000 )<br>
Accidents: The number of accidents the car has been in (e.g., 1 )<br>
Your function should return a structure with all the above fields,
with <b>exactly</b> the same names. It should have the same make, year,
accidents, and miles. Here are the changes you must make:
<ul>
<li>Add 5,000 to the cost if the car has clocked <a id="2455"></a><a id="2456"></a>less than
20,000 miles</li>
<li>Subtract 5,000 if it has clocked more than 100,000 miles.</li>
<li>Reduce the price by 10,000 for every accident.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This problem deals with structures that represent dates.
<ul>
<li>First, write a MATLAB function called createDate that will take
in three numeric parameters. The first parameter represents the
month , the second the day , and the third the year. The function
should return a structure with the following fields:<br>
Day: a number<br>
Month: a 3 character string containing the first three characters
of the month name<br>
Year: a number containing the year.<br>
For example,<br>
it = createDate(3,30,2008) should return a structure containing:<br>
Day: 30<br>
Month: Mar<br>
Year: 2008<br></li>
<li>Write a function called printDate that displays a date in the form
Mar 30, 2007</li>
<li>Write a function inBetween that will take in three date
structures. The function should return true if the second date is
between the first and third dates, otherwise the function should
return false.</li>
<li>Write a function called isSorted that takes in a single parameter,
an array of date structures. This function should return true if
all the dates in the array are in a chronological order (regardless
of whether they are in ascending or descending order),<br>
 -> It might help to add a field to the date class.<br>
 -> The third date does not have to be chronologically
later than the first date.
otherwise the function should return false.</li>
<li>Write a test script that creates an
array of date structures, prints out
each date, and then states whether
or not the dates are in order.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your university has added a new award for students who were "almost there" last
semester and just missed getting into the Dean's List. Write a function called almost
that consumes an array of student structures, and produces an array of names of
those who have a semester GPA between 2.9 and 2.99 (inclusive). The student
structure has the following fields:<br>
Name - string (e.g., 'George P. Burdell')<br>
Semester_GPA - decimal number (e.g., 2.97)<br>
Cumulative_GPA - decimal number (e.g., 3.01)<br></li>
<li>The MATLAB language has the built-in ability to perform
mathematical operations on complex numbers. However, there are
times when it is useful to treat complex numbers as a structure.
Write a set of functions with the following capability and a script to
verify that they work correctly:<br>
cmplx = makeComplex(real, imag)<br>
res = cmplxAdd( cmpxa, cmpxb )<br>
res = cmplxMult( cmpxa, cmpxb )</li>
<li>In terms of atomic <a id="2491"></a>physics, every electron has four numbers
associated with it, called the quantum numbers. These are
'principal' (energy), 'azimuthal' (angular momentum), 'magnetic'
(orientation of angular momentum), and 'spin' (particle spin)
quantum numbers. Wolfgang Pauli hypothesized (correctly) that no
two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum
numbers; that is, if the Principal, Azimuthal, and Magnetic
numbers are the same for two electrons, then it is necessary for the
electrons to have different Spin numbers.
You need to write a function called spinSwitch that takes in two
structures and returns both structures. Each structure represents an
electron in a hydrogen atom and has the following fields:<br>
principal (this is always > 0)<br>
azimuthal (a number)<br>
magnetic (a number)<br>
spin (a string with value 'up' or 'down')<br>
Your function will compare the values in the two structures and
check if they all have the same values for the four fields. If true, you
are required to switch the spin of the second structure. You also
have to add a field called "energy" to both structures. The value
stored in this field must be ( -2.18*(10^18))/(n^2), where n is the
value of the principal quantum number for that electron. You have
to return both the structures with the energy field added to both, so
that the one with the higher energy is first. If the energies are <a id="2346"></a>equal,
return the one with the 'up' spin first. If both have the same spin
and the same energy, the order does not matter.
