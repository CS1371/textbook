  <!-- Chapter Objectives -->
  <h2>Chapter Objectives</h2>
  <div class="container">
    <p>This chapter discusses techniques for<a id="2233">!</a> changing the flow of control in a program, which may be necessary for<a id="2234">!</a> two reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>You may want to execute some parts of the code under certain specific circumstances</li>
      <li>You may want to repeat a section of code a certain number of times</li>
    </ul>
    In Chapter 3 we used the array<a id="2144">!</a> notation to gather numbers<a id="2405">!</a> into a form where they could be processed collectively rather than individually. This chapter deals with code blocks (collections of one or more lines of code) that solve a particular segment of a problem in the same way. We will see how to define a code block, how to decide to execute a code block under certain conditions only, and how to repeat execution<a id="2209">!</a> of a code block.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="chp-section" data-sect-num="1" data-sect-name="Concept: Code Blocks">
    <!-- Concept: Code Blocks -->
    <h2 id="5_1">5.1	Concept: Code Blocks</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <p>A code block is a collection<a id="2167">!</a> of zero or more computer<a id="2174">!</a> instructions packaged together in order to treat them as a single entity.  This allows us to selectively execute or skip some blocks or to repeat them under contolled circumstances. Some computer<a id="2175">!</a> languages identify code blocks by enclosing them in braces (<code>{. . .}</code>); others identify them by the level of indentation of the text<a id="2453">!</a>. The MATLAB<a id="2373">!</a> language uses the occurrence of key words in the text<a id="2454">!</a> to define the extent of code blocks. Keywords like <code><font color="blue">if, switch<a id="2438">!</a>, while<a id="2520">!</a>, for<a id="2235">!</a>, case<a id="2162">!</a>, otherwise, else<a id="2186">!</a>, elseif<a id="2190">!</a>, </code></font>and<code><font color="blue"> end<a id="2195">!</a></font></code> are identified with blue coloring by the MATLAB<a id="2374">!</a> text<a id="2455">!</a> editor. They are not part of the code block, but they serve as instructions on what to do with the code block and as delimiters that define the extent of the code block. So, for<a id="2236">!</a> example, all the commands in a script are a code block that terminates either at the end<a id="2196">!</a> of the script or at the beginning of the first function<a id="2303">!</a> definition.  Similarly, in a function<a id="2304">!</a> definition, the body of the code from the function<a id="2305">!</a> key word to the "matching" end<a id="2197">!</a> is a code block.  As we will soon see, code blocks can be nested within code blocks, each having a beginning key word with a matching end<a id="2198">!</a>.</p>

        <p class="figure-name card-title">Figure 5.1: Simple if statement</p>
      </div>
      <p>To this point, the statements written in our scripts<a id="2427">!</a> and functions have been executed in sequence from the instruction at the top to the instruction at the bottom. However, it is frequently necessary to make choices about how to process a set of data based on some characteristic of that data. We have seen logical<a id="2339">!</a> expressions that result in a Logical result — <code>true</code> or <code>false<a id="2214">!</a></code>. This section discusses the code that implements the idea shown in Figure 5.1.  </p>
      <p>In the flowchart shown in Figure 5.1, a set of statements (the code block to be executed) is shown as a rectangle, a decision point is shown as a diamond, and the flow of program control is indicated by arrows. When decision points are drawn, there will be at least two arrows leaving that symbol, each labeled with the reason one would take that path. This concept makes the execution<a id="2210">!</a> of a code block conditional upon some test. If the result of the test is <code>true</code>, the code block is executed. Otherwise, the default code block is executed.  If the default code block is empty<a id="2192">!</a> when the test fails, no code is executed and control proceeds to the instruction(s) after the end<a id="2199">!</a> of the code block.</p>
      <p>An important generalization of this concept is shown in Figure 5.2.  Here the solution is generalized to permit the first code block to be implemented under the first condition as before. Now, however, if that first logical<a id="2340">!</a> test returns false<a id="2215">!</a>, a second test is performed to determine whether the second code block should be executed. If that test returns false<a id="2216">!</a>, as many further tests as necessary may be performed, each with the appropriate code block to be implemented when the result is true. Finally, if none of these tests return true, the last code block, usually identified by the else<a id="2187">!</a> keyword—(n 1 1) in the figure—is executed. As the flowchart shows, as soon as one of the code blocks is executed, the next instruction to execute is the one that follows the conditional code after the end<a id="2200">!</a> statement. In particular, if there is no else<a id="2188">!</a> clause, it is possible that no code at all is executed in this conditional statement.<p>

      <p>There are two common styles in which to implement this conditional behavior. First we will discuss the most general form, the if statement, and then we will discuss the more restrictive, but tidier, switch<a id="2439">!</a> statement. Both implementations are found in most modern languages, albeit with slightly different syntax. In each case<a id="2163">!</a>, the code block to be implemented is all the statements between the key words colored blue by the MATLAB<a id="2375">!</a> editor.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <p>Here we introduce the concept of a programming<a id="2421">!</a> template. Many programming<a id="2422">!</a> texts still use the idea of flowcharts<a id="2232">!</a>, such as those illustrated in Figures 5.1 and 5.2, to describe the design of a solution in a manner independent of the code implementation. However, since this graphical form cannot be maintained with a text<a id="2456">!</a> editor, if the design of the solution changes, it is difficult to maintain any design description that is separate from the code itself.</p>
      <p>Throughout the remainder of this text<a id="2457">!</a>, we will describe the overall design of a code module using a design template. Design templates are a textual form of flowchart consisting of the key words that control program flow and placeholders that identify the code blocks and expressions that are necessary to implement the solution logic<a id="2333">!</a>. Design templates are powerful tools for<a id="2237">!</a> the novice programmer to overcome the “blank sheet of paper” problem—“how do I start solving this problem?” All programmers need to do is recognize the nature of the solution and write down the appropriate template. Then solving a particular problem becomes the relatively simple task of writing the code blocks identified by the template.</p>
      <p>To discuss the if statement, first we consider its general, language independent template and then its MATLAB<a id="2376">!</a> implementation.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <p>There are two important ideas that are necessary for<a id="2238">!</a> the successful implementation of <code>if</code> statements: the general form of the logical<a id="2344">!</a> expressions and short-circuit<a id="2429">!</a> analysis.</p>
        <p><b>Logical Expressions</b>: The <code>if</code> statement requires a logical<a id="2345">!</a> expression for<a id="2239">!</a> its condition. A logical<a id="2346">!</a> expression is any collection<a id="2168">!</a> of constants, variables, and operators<a id="2416">!</a> whose result is a logical<a id="2347">!</a> <code>true</code> or <code>false<a id="2217">!</a></code> value<a id="2461">!</a>. Logical expressions can be created in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The value<a id="2462">!</a> of a Logical constant (e.g., <code>true</code> or <code>false<a id="2218">!</a></code>)</li>
          <li>The value<a id="2463">!</a> of a variable<a id="2496">!</a> containing a Logical result (e.g., <code>found</code>)</li>
          <li>The result of a logical<a id="2348">!</a> operation<a id="2413">!</a> on two scalar<a id="2424">!</a> quantities (e.g., <code>A > 5</code>)</li>
          <li>The result of negating a logical<a id="2349">!</a> quantity using the unary<a id="2460">!</a> negation operator (e.g., <code>~found</code>)</li>
          <li>The result of combining multiple scalar<a id="2425">!</a> logical<a id="2350">!</a> expressions with the operators<a id="2417">!</a> and (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) or or (<code>||</code>) (e.g., <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> (<code>A &amp;&amp; B</code>) or <code>A</code> or <code>B</code> (<code>A || B</code>)). </li>
          <li>The results of the functions that are the logical<a id="2351">!</a> equivalent of the <code>&amp;&amp;</code>,
          <code>||</code>, and <code>~</code> operators<a id="2418">!</a>: <code>and(<a id="2141">!</a>A, B)</code> <code>or(A, B)</code> and <code>not(A)</code></li>
          <li>The results of other functions that operate on logical<a id="2352">!</a> vectors<a id="2518">!</a>: <code>any(<a id="2142">!</a>...)</code> and <code>all(<a id="2138">!</a>...)</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Note carefully:</b>
        <ol>
          <li>The "variables" <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> in the examples above may be considered as surrogates for<a id="2240">!</a> arbitrarily complex expressions that may be enclosed in parentheses for<a id="2241">!</a> clarity and result in the values <code>true</code> or <code>false<a id="2219">!</a></code>.</li>
          <li>The result from <code>any(<a id="2143">!</a>...)</code> will be <code>true</code> if any logical<a id="2353">!</a> value<a id="2464">!</a> in the vector is <code>true</code>. The result from <code>all(<a id="2139">!</a>...)</code> will be true only if all logical<a id="2354">!</a> values in the vector are <code>true</code>. </li>
          <li>The function<a id="2306">!</a> <code>all(<a id="2140">!</a>...)</code> is implicitly called if you supply a vector of logical<a id="2355">!</a> values to the <code>if</code> statement, as shown in Listing 5.3.</li>
          <li>The MATLAB<a id="2379">!</a> Command<a id="2172">!</a> window echoes logical<a id="2356">!</a>
          results as <code>1</code> (<code>true</code>) or <code>0</code> (<code>false<a id="2220">!</a></code>). In spite of this
          appearance, logical<a id="2357">!</a> values are not numeric and should
          never be treated as if they were.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="listing">#listing_05_3#</div>
        <p><b>Short-Circuit Evaluation</b>: When evaluating a sequence of logical<a id="2358">!</a> <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code> expressions, MATLAB<a id="2380">!</a> will stop processing when it finds the first result that makes all subsequent processing irrelevant. This concept is best illustrated by an example. Assume that <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are logical<a id="2359">!</a> results and you want to evaluate <code>A &amp;&amp; B</code>. Since the result of this is <code>true</code> only if both <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are <code>true</code>, if you evaluate <code>A</code> and the result is <code>false<a id="2221">!</a></code>, no value<a id="2465">!</a> of <code>B</code> can possibly change the outcome <code>A &amp;&amp; B</code>.	Therefore, there is no reason to evaluate any more components of a logical<a id="2360">!</a> and expression once a false<a id="2222">!</a> result has been found. Similarly, if you want <code>A || B</code>, if <code>A</code> is found to be <code>true</code>, you do not need to evaluate <code>B</code>.</p>
        <p>For example,suppose you want to test the nth element of a vector <code>v</code> using a variable<a id="2497">!</a> <code>n</code>,
        and you are concerned that <code>n</code> might not be a legal index value<a id="2466">!</a>. The following code could be used:</p>
        <p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;if (n &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (n &lt;= length(<a id="2329">!</a>v)) &amp;&amp; (v(n) &gt; 0)<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;% success!<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;end<a id="2202">!</a>
        </code></p>
        <p>If <code>n</code> were not a legal index, the indexed accessor <code>v(n)</code> would cause an error for<a id="2242">!</a> attempting to reach beyond the end<a id="2203">!</a> of the vector. However, by putting the tests of <code>n</code> first, the short-circuit<a id="2430">!</a> logic<a id="2335">!</a> would not process the last part of the expression if either test of <code>n</code> failed.</p>

In some languages - especially those with their origins in C - the variable<a id="2505">!</a> specification is a formidable collection<a id="2169">!</a> of statements that provide great generality of loop management. The designers of the MATLAB<a id="2388">!</a> language, with its origins in matrix<a id="2402">!</a> processing, chose a much simpler approach for<a id="2257">!</a> specifying the variable<a id="2506">!</a> range, as shown in the general template.

      <div class="container">
        <p>The core concept in the MATLAB<a id="2390">!</a> for<a id="2258">!</a> loop implementation is embedded in the logic<a id="2337">!</a> of the variable<a id="2508">!</a> specification, which is accomplished as follows:</p>
        <p><code>&lt;variable<a id="2509">!</a> specification&gt;: &lt;variable<a id="2510">!</a>&gt; = &lt;vector&gt;</code></p>
        <p>where <code>&lt;variable<a id="2511">!</a>&gt;</code> is the name of the loop control variable<a id="2512">!</a> and <code>&lt;vector&gt;</code> is any vector that can be created by the techniques discussed in Chapter 4.</p>
        <p>If we were to use the variable<a id="2513">!</a> specification <code> x = A</code>, MATLAB<a id="2391">!</a> would proceed as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>Set an invisible index to 1.</li>
          <li>Repeat steps 3 to 5 as long as that index is less<a id="2330">!</a> than or equal<a id="2208">!</a> to the length of A.</li>
          <li>Set the value<a id="2475">!</a> of x to A(index)</li>
          <li>Evaluate the code block with that value<a id="2476">!</a> of x</li>
          <li>Increment the index</li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>For a simple example of for<a id="2259">!</a> loops, the code shown in Listing 5.5 solves a problem that should be done in a single MATLAB<a id="2392">!</a> instruction: <code>max(<a id="2403">!</a>A)</code> where <code>A</code> is a vector of integers. However, by expanding this into a <code>for<a id="2260">!</a></code> loop, we see the basic structure<a id="2437">!</a> of the <code>for<a id="2261">!</a></code> loop at work. </p>

              By setting the default answer to the first value<a id="2477">!</a>, we avoid the problem of seeding the result with a value<a id="2478">!</a> that could be already outside the range of the vector values. For example, we might think that<br><code>theMax = 0;</code><br> would be a satisfactory seed. However, this would not do well if all the elements<a id="2184">!</a> of A were negative.

        <p>The above for<a id="2262">!</a> loop implementation may seem very strange to those with a C-based language background, in which the loop-control variable<a id="2514">!</a> is usually an index into the array<a id="2146">!</a> being traversed rather than an element from that array<a id="2147">!</a>. In order to illustrate the difference, we will adapt the code from Listing 5.5 to solve a slightly different problem that approximates the behavior of max(<a id="2404">!</a>A). This time we need to know not only the maximum value<a id="2479">!</a> in the array<a id="2148">!</a>, but also its index.

        <p><b>Note:</b> This use of the <code>break<a id="2155">!</a></code> statement explains why it is really bad to put <code>break<a id="2156">!</a></code> statements inside switch<a id="2447">!</a> statements.

<h3>Programming Projects</h3>
<ol>
<li>Write a script to solve this problem. Assume that you have a vector
named D. Using iteration<a id="2326">!</a> (for and/or while<a id="2540">!</a>) and conditionals (if
and/or switch<a id="2452">!</a>), separate vector D into four vectors<a id="2519">!</a> posEven,
negEven, posOdd, and negOdd.
<ul>
<li>posEven contains all of the positive even numbers<a id="2407">!</a> in D.</li>
    <li>negEven contains all of the negative even numbers<a id="2408">!</a> in D.</li>
    <li>posOdd contains all of the positive odd numbers<a id="2409">!</a> in D.</li>
    <li>negOdd contains all of the negative odd numbers<a id="2410">!</a> in D.
</ul>
For example:
if D = [-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4],
posEven=[2,4], negEven=[-4,-2],
posOdd=[1,3] and negOdd=[-3,-1]</li>
    <li>You must use either for<a id="2282">!</a> or while<a id="2541">!</a> to solve the following problems.
	<ul>
<li> Iterate through a vector, A, using a for<a id="2283">!</a> loop, and create a new
vector, B, containing logical<a id="2369">!</a> values. The new vector should
contain true for<a id="2284">!</a> positive values and false<a id="2223">!</a> for<a id="2285">!</a> all other values. For
example, if A = [ -300 2 5 -63 4 0 -46], the result should be
B = [false<a id="2224">!</a> true true false<a id="2225">!</a> true true false<a id="2226">!</a>]</li>
    <li>Iterate through the vector, A, using a while<a id="2542">!</a> loop, and return a new
vector, B, containing true for<a id="2286">!</a> positive values and false<a id="2227">!</a> for<a id="2287">!</a> all
other values.</li>
    <li>Iterate through a logical<a id="2370">!</a> array<a id="2150">!</a>, N, using a for<a id="2288">!</a> loop, and return a
new vector, M, containing the value<a id="2483">!</a> 2 wherever an element of N is
true and the value<a id="2484">!</a> -1 (not a logical<a id="2371">!</a> value<a id="2485">!</a>) wherever N is false<a id="2228">!</a>.
For example, if N = [true false<a id="2229">!</a> false<a id="2230">!</a> true true false<a id="2231">!</a> true],
the result should be M = [2 -1 -1 2 2 -1 2]</li>
    <li>Iterate through an array<a id="2151">!</a>, Z, using a while<a id="2543">!</a> loop. Replace every
element with the number 3 until you reach a number larger than
50. Leave the rest unchanged. For example, if Z = [4 3 2 5 7 9 0

    <li>You are hiring grad students to work for<a id="2289">!</a> your company, which you
have recently started. The Human Resources department has asked
you to write a script that will help<a id="2312">!</a> them determine the chances of an
individual applicant getting a job after interviewing. The following
table outlines the rules for<a id="2290">!</a> determining the chances for<a id="2291">!</a> the applicant
to get a job:
<table>
<tr><th>GPA Value</th><th>Chance of Being Hired</th></tr>
<tr><td>GPA>= 3.5</td><td>90%</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.0<= GPA < 3.5</td><td>80%</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.5 <= GPA < 3.0</td><td>70%</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.0 <= GPA < 2.5</td><td>60%</td></tr>
<tr><td>1.5 <= GPA < 2.0</td><td>40%</td></tr>
<tr><td>GPA < 1.5</td><td>30%</td></tr>
</table>
Your script should repeatedly ask the user for<a id="2292">!</a> a GPA value<a id="2486">!</a> and
compute the student's chances of being hired. It should continue<a id="2182">!</a> asking
for<a id="2293">!</a> GPA values until a negative number is entered. <br>
For example:
<ul>
<li>GPA input: 4 should give the answer 0.9</li>
    <li>GPA input: 3.5 should give the answer 0.9</li>
    <li>GPA input: 3.4 should give the answer 0.8</li>
</ul>
    <li>You were just hired for<a id="2294">!</a> a summer internship with one of the area's
best software companies; however, on your first day of work you
learn that for<a id="2295">!</a> the next three months, the only job you will have is to
convert binary<a id="2152">!</a> (base 2) numbers<a id="2411">!</a> into decimal numbers<a id="2412">!</a> (base 10).
You decide to write a script that will repetitively ask the user for<a id="2296">!</a> a
binary<a id="2153">!</a> number and return its decimal equivalent until an illegal
number (one containing digits other than 0 or 1) is entered. The
number entered should contain only the digits 0 and 1. The
rightmost digit has the value<a id="2487">!</a> 2 0 and the digit N places to the left of
that has the value<a id="2488">!</a> 2<sup>N</sup>. <br>
For example, <br>
entering 110101 returns
53 = 25 + 24 + 23 + 20
You must use iteration<a id="2327">!</a> to solve this problem. <br>
Note: The input (...) function<a id="2308">!</a> prompts the user for<a id="2297">!</a> a value<a id="2489">!</a>, parses the characters entered
according to normal MATLAB<a id="2401">!</a> rules, and returns the result.</li>
    <li>You have a friend who<a id="2545">!</a> has too many clothes to store in his or her
tiny wardrobe. Being a good friend, you offer to help<a id="2313">!</a> to decide
whether each piece of clothing is worth saving. You decide to write
a script that will compute the value<a id="2490">!</a> of each piece of clothing. A
piece of clothing has five attributes that can be used to determine its
value<a id="2491">!</a>. The attributes are: condition, color<a id="2170">!</a>, price, number of matches,
and comfort. Each attribute will be rated on a scale<a id="2426">!</a> of 1 to 5. Write a
script called clothes that will ask the user for<a id="2298">!</a> the ratings for<a id="2299">!</a> each
attribute and store the result in a vector. The order of attributes in
the vector is: [condition color<a id="2171">!</a> price matches comfort]
The script should compute a value<a id="2492">!</a> between 0 and 100; 100 represents
a good piece of clothing, while<a id="2544">!</a> 0 represents a bad piece of clothing.
The points that should be given for<a id="2300">!</a> each attribute are shown below:<br>
<table>
<tr><th>Condition:</th><td>1=>0; 2=>5; 3=>10; 4=>15; 5=>20</td></tr>
<tr><th>Color:</th><td>1 => blue => 12;</td></tr>
<tr><th></th><td>2 => red => 2;</td></tr>
<tr><th></th><td>3 => pink => 15;</td></tr>
<tr><th></th><td>4 => yellow => 20;</td></tr>
<tr><th></th><td>5 => white => 12</td></tr>
<tr><th>Price:</th><td>1 => 8, 2-3 => 16, 4-5 => 20</td></tr>
<tr><th>Matches:</th><td>1-2 => 8, 3-5 => 19</td></tr>
<tr><th>Comfort:</th><td>1 => 6, 2-3 => 13, 4-5 =>18</td></tr>
</table>
Note: If a number other than 1-5 is assigned for<a id="2301">!</a> one of the
attributes, no points should be given.</li>
    <li>A "yard" is a traditional English container. It is 36 inches long, and
can be approximated by a 4-inch diameter glass sphere<a id="2433">!</a> attached to
a conical section whose narrow end<a id="2206">!</a> is 1 inch in diameter, and
whose wide end<a id="2207">!</a> is 6 inches in diameter. <br>
Write a script to do the following: <br>
<ul>
<li>ask the user for<a id="2302">!</a> the height of the liquid in the yard, and</li>
<li>calculate the volume of liquid needed to fill the yard to that level.</li>
</ul>
    <li>Now that you're comfortable with iteration<a id="2328">!</a>, you’re going to have to
solve an interesting problem. It seems that the Math department at a
rival university has once again dropped the ball, and forgotten the
value<a id="2493">!</a> of pi. You are to write a function<a id="2309">!</a> called mypi, which consumes
a number that specifies the required accuracy and then
approximates the value<a id="2494">!</a> of pi to that accuracy. You are going to use
the following algorithm based on geometric probability.
Think about a quarter circle inside of a unit square<a id="2434">!</a> (the quarter
circle has area p/4). You pick a random point inside the square<a id="2435">!</a>. If it
is in the quarter circle, you get a "hit"; and if not, you get a "miss."
The approximate area of the quarter circle will be given by the
number of hits divided by the number of points you chose.
Your function<a id="2310">!</a> should repeat the process of counting
hits and misses until at least 10,000 tries have been
made, and the successive estimates of pi are within
the prescribed accuracy. It should return the
estimated value<a id="2495">!</a> of pi.<br>
Hint: you could use the function<a id="2311">!</a> rand (...) in this problem.</li>
