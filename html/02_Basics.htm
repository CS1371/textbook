	<!-- Introduction -->
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<div class="container">
		<p>The name MATLAB<a id="1021">!</a> is a contraction of Matrix Laboratory. It was developed for<a id="945">!</a> engineers to create, manipulate, and visualize matrices<a id="1093">!</a>&mdash;rectangular arrays of numerical<a id="1098">!</a> values. At its most basic level, MATLAB<a id="1022">!</a> can perform the same functions as your scientific calculator, but it has expanded far beyond its original capabilities and now provides an interactive system and programming<a id="1138">!</a> language for<a id="946">!</a> many applications, including financial analysis as well as general scientific and technical computation. The following are the fundamental components of MATLAB<a id="1023">!</a>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A computing system that accepts one instruction at a time in text<a id="1181">!</a> form and implements the logic<a id="1016">!</a> of that instruction. Instructions must conform to a specific syntax and vocabulary, which will be the topic of Chapters 3&ndash;9.</li>
			<li>A large library of modules that provide high-level<a id="1007">!</a> capabilities for<a id="947">!</a> processing data<a id="864">!</a>. These modules will be the major topic of Chapters 10&ndash;17.</li>
			<li>A graphical user interface (GUI) that lets users assemble and implement programs that solve specific problems. The rest of this chapter will describe the basic behavior of these windows<a id="1290">!</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>MATLAB<a id="1024">!</a> offers a number of advantages to users over conventional, compiled languages like C++, Java, or FOR<a id="1112">!</a>TRAN:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Because MATLAB<a id="1025">!</a> programs are interpreted<a id="1012">!</a> rather than compiled, the process of producing a working solution can be much quicker than with compiled languages.</li>
			<li>MATLAB<a id="1026">!</a> excels at numerical<a id="1099">!</a> calculations, especially matrix<a id="1094">!</a> calculations.</li>
			<li>MATLAB<a id="1027">!</a> has built-in graphics capabilities that produce professional-looking images<a id="1009">!</a> for<a id="948">!</a> reports.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>However, the very attributes that make MATLAB<a id="1028">!</a> convenient for<a id="949">!</a> a user to develop quick<a id="1164">!</a> solutions to certain problems make it unsuitable for<a id="950">!</a> other kinds of projects. For example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>MATLAB<a id="1029">!</a> does not work well for<a id="951">!</a> large computing projects where a number of developers share coding responsibilities.</li>
			<li>Professional GUIs and windowing applications (like the MATLAB<a id="1030">!</a> system itself) are best written in a compiled language.</li>

		<h2 id="2_1">2.1 Programming Language Background</h2>
		<div class="container">
			<p>Before learning about concepts in computing, you need to understand the background of programming<a id="1139">!</a> languages. This section discusses the following aspects of programming<a id="1140">!</a> languages: abstraction<a id="729">!</a>, algorithms<a id="742">!</a>, programming<a id="1141">!</a> paradigms<a id="1116">!</a>, and three fundamental concepts of programming<a id="1142">!</a>&mdash;assigning values to variables, data<a id="865">!</a> typing, and the difference between classes<a id="780">!</a> and objects<a id="1103">!</a>.</p>

		<div class="chp-subsection" data-sub-num="1" data-sub-name="Abstraction">
			<!-- Abstraction -->
			<h3 id="2_1_1">2.1.1 Abstraction</h3>
			<div class="container">
				<p>For the purpose of this text<a id="1182">!</a>, we will define abstraction<a id="730">!</a> as &ldquo;expressing a quality apart from a particular implementation.&rdquo; We use the concept of abstraction<a id="731">!</a> in everyday conversation without thinking about it:</p>
				<p><code>&ldquo;To convert from degrees Celsius to Kelvin, you add 273 to the temperature.&rdquo;</code><br>
				<code>&ldquo;drive home.&rdquo; </code></p>
				<p>The first is an example of <strong>data<a id="866">!</a> abstraction<a id="732">!</a></strong>. <code>&ldquo;The temperature&rdquo;</code> could mean a single reading from the thermometer hanging outside the window or a table of temperature readings for<a id="952">!</a> the month of August. The specifics are unimportant; the phrase captures all you need to know. The second example is actually much more complex &mdash; an example of multiple levels of <strong>procedural<a id="1120">!</a> abstraction<a id="733">!</a></strong>. To a person taking the same route home every night, <code>&ldquo;drive home&rdquo;</code> is all that is required to understand the idea. To a competent driver unfamiliar with the route, the next level of abstraction<a id="734">!</a> might be necessary&mdash;turn right out of the parking lot, left onto Main Street, and so on. For instructions to guide a future robotic commuter vehicle, an incredibly fine-grained level of abstraction<a id="735">!</a> will be required. Everything taken for<a id="953">!</a> granted in the higher level abstractions will need to be meticulously spelled out for<a id="954">!</a> the robotic vehicle &mdash; start the engine, accelerate the vehicle, look out for<a id="955">!</a> traffic, keep in the lane, find the turn, steer the vehicle, control the speed, observe and obey all signs, and so on.</p>

		<div class="chp-subsection" data-sub-num="2" data-sub-name="Algorithms">
			<!-- Algorithms -->
			<h3 id="2_1_2">2.1.2 Algorithms</h3>

					<img src="..\Images\Fig_2_0.JPG" alt="Figure 2.1" class="fig card-image">
					<p class="figure-name card-title">Figure 2.1: Problem Decomposition</p>
				</div>
				<p>Chapter 1 defined problem solving as the ability to isolate sub-problems that seem simple and appropriate to solve, and then assemble the solutions to these sub-problems. The solutions to each of these sub-problems would be expressed as an <b>algorithm</b>, which is a sequence of instructions for<a id="956">!</a> solving a sub-problem. The process of solving each sub-problem and assembling the solutions to form the solution to the whole problem could also be expressed as an algorithm at a higher level of abstraction<a id="736">!</a>.</p>
				<p>The level of abstraction<a id="737">!</a> needed to describe an algorithm varies greatly with the mechanism available. For example, describing the algorithm (recipe) for<a id="957">!</a> baking cookies might take the following forms:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>To your grandmother, who<a id="1289">!</a> has been baking cookies for<a id="958">!</a> the last 50 years, it might be <code>&ldquo;Please bake some cookies.&rdquo;</code></li>
					<li>To others it might be <code>&ldquo;Buy a cookie mix and follow the directions.&rdquo;</code></li>
					<li>To a young person learning to cook from scratch, the algorithm might include an intricate series of instructions for<a id="959">!</a> measuring, sifting, and combining ingredients; setting the oven temperature and preheating the oven; forming the cookies and putting them on the cookie sheet; and so on.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In programming<a id="1143">!</a> terms, algorithms<a id="743">!</a> are frequently expressed first conceptually at a high level of abstraction<a id="738">!</a>, as illustrated in Figure 2.1. The solutions to each sub-problem would then be expressed at lower and lower levels of abstraction<a id="739">!</a> until the description is sufficient to write programs that solve each sub-problem, thereby contributing the pieces that, when assembled, solve the whole problem.</p>

		<div class="chp-subsection" data-sub-num="3" data-sub-name="Programming Paradigms">
			<!-- Programming Paradigms -->
			<h3 id="2_1_3">2.1.3 Programming Paradigms</h3>
			<div class="container">
				<p>From the Greek word <i>paradeigma</i>&mdash;&ldquo;to show alongside&rdquo;&mdash;the American Heritage Dictionary defines a paradigm as &ldquo;a set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality for<a id="960">!</a> the community that shares them, especially in an intellectual discipline.&rdquo; So a programming<a id="1144">!</a> paradigm becomes a codified set of practices allowing the community of computing professionals to frame their ideas. This section considers three radically different paradigms<a id="1117">!</a>: functional<a id="1002">!</a> programming<a id="1145">!</a>, procedural<a id="1121">!</a> programming<a id="1146">!</a>, and object-oriented<a id="1101">!</a> programming<a id="1147">!</a>.</p>
				<p><b>Functional programming<a id="1148">!</a></b> is typically associated with languages like Lisp and Forth, in which every programming<a id="1149">!</a> operation<a id="1104">!</a> is actually implemented as a function<a id="999">!</a> call with no side effects (changes of state of the program<a id="1124">!</a> surroundings) permitted or implemented in the language. Without side effects, a programming<a id="1150">!</a> solution can be mathematically proven to be correct&mdash;an enormous advantage. Except for<a id="961">!</a> the discussion of recursion<a id="1166">!</a>, this paradigm will not be mentioned again.</p>
				<p><b>Procedural programming<a id="1151">!</a></b> is typical of languages like FOR<a id="1113">!</a>TRAN, C, and MATLAB<a id="1031">!</a>, where the basic programs or sub-programs are sequences of operations<a id="1107">!</a> on data<a id="867">!</a> items that are generally accessible to all programs. Although side effects from sub-programs&mdash;such as changing the values of variables outside that sub-program<a id="1125">!</a>&mdash;are considered poor practice, they are not prohibited by the language.</p>
				<p><b>Object-oriented programming<a id="1152">!</a> (OOP)</b>, typical of languages like C++, Ada, and Java, is a relatively new addition to the world of programming<a id="1153">!</a> paradigms<a id="1118">!</a>. It is characterized by the concept of encapsulating, or packaging, data<a id="868">!</a> items together with the methods or functions that manipulate those data<a id="869">!</a> items. In this paradigm, side effects are explicitly managed by controlling access to the data<a id="870">!</a> and methods in a particular grouping. The major theme in true OOP is that &ldquo;everything is an object.&rdquo; You will see MATLAB<a id="1032">!</a> exhibiting many traits of OOP as you work through this book, but you will not need to use this programming<a id="1154">!</a> paradigm.</p>

			<!-- Assigning Values to Variables -->
			<h3 id="2_2_2">2.2.2 Assigning Values to Variables</h3>
			<div class="container">
				<p>The concept of assigning values to variables is the first challenge facing novice programmers. The difficulty arises because many programming<a id="1155">!</a> languages (including MATLAB<a id="1039">!</a>) present this simple concept in a syntax that is very similar to conventional algebra, but with significantly different meaning. Consider, for<a id="962">!</a> example, the following algebraic expression:</p>
				<p><code>z = x + y</code></p>
				<p>In normal algebra, this is a two-way relationship that is an identity for<a id="963">!</a> the duration of the problem. If you knew the values of <code>z</code> and <code>x</code>, you could derive the value<a id="1205">!</a> of <code>y</code> with no further analysis. To a programmer, however, this statement has a different meaning. It means that you want to sum the values given to the variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and store the result in a variable<a id="1229">!</a> called <code>z</code>. If either <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> is unknown at the time of executing this statement, an error ensues. In particular, this relationship is true only for<a id="964">!</a> this statement. The relationship can be revoked in the next instruction, which might be:</p>
				<p><code>z = 4*x - y</code></p>
				<p>In algebra, this pair of statements collectively constrains the values of <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>. In programming<a id="1156">!</a>, the only significance is that the programmer decided to calculate the current value<a id="1206">!</a> of <code>z</code> differently. A few computer<a id="844">!</a> languages are sensitive to this dilemma and use a different symbol for<a id="965">!</a> assigning values to a variable<a id="1230">!</a>. For example, in Pascal or Ada, an instruction to assign the value<a id="1207">!</a> <code>z = x + y</code> would be written as follows: <code>z := x + y</code> The &ldquo;<code>:=</code>&rdquo; operator clearly indicates that this is an assignment<a id="748">!</a> statement, not an algebraic identity.</p>
				<p><strong>Variable<a id="1223">!</a> names</strong>: In general, variable<a id="1231">!</a> names may contain any combination of uppercase and lowercase alphabetic letters, numbers<a id="1095">!</a>, and the special characters <code>_</code> (underscore) and <code>$</code> (dollar). The underscore<a id="1202">!</a> character<a id="770">!</a> is frequently used to represent a space in a variable<a id="1232">!</a> name because spaces are not allowed. However, variable<a id="1233">!</a> names may not begin with a numeric character<a id="771">!</a>, and even though the names may be hundreds of characters long, the first 64 characters must be unique. Exercise 2.2 demonstrates the assignment<a id="749">!</a> of values to variables.</p>

			      <p class="card-title">Style Points 2.1</p>
			      <p class="card-text">
							<p ID="250">1. Some early versions of the FOR<a id="1114">!</a>TRAN and Basic languages severely restricted the number of characters you could use for<a id="966">!</a> variable<a id="1234">!</a> names. It is no longer necessary to program<a id="1126">!</a> as if you were still in the &ldquo;bad old days.&rdquo; Choose names for<a id="967">!</a> variables that describe their content. For example, a variable<a id="1235">!</a> used to store the velocity of an object should be named <code>velocity_in_feet_per_second</code> rather than <code>v</code>.</p>
							<p>2. Since the space character<a id="772">!</a> is not permitted in variable<a id="1236">!</a> names, there are two conventions for<a id="968">!</a> joining multiple words together to make a single variable<a id="1237">!</a> name. One uses the underscore<a id="1203">!</a> character<a id="773">!</a> to separate the words (<code>file_size</code>), and the other capitalizes the first letter of additional words (<code>fileSize</code>).You should choose one convention and be consistent with it. You cannot use a hyphen to concatenate words&mdash;MATLAB<a id="1040">!</a> treats the name <code>file-size</code> as the arithmetic<a id="745">!</a> operation<a id="1105">!</a> subtracting the value<a id="1208">!</a> of the variable<a id="1238">!</a> <code>size</code> from the value<a id="1209">!</a> of the variable<a id="1239">!</a> <code>file</code>.</p>
					</div>
				<p>It is important to understand how MATLAB<a id="1041">!</a> treats the data<a id="873">!</a> stored in a variable<a id="1240">!</a>. Different languages take varying approaches to this problem, and languages in general fall into two broad categories: untyped and typed. In general, interpreted<a id="1013">!</a> languages like Lisp, Forth, Python, and MATLAB<a id="1042">!</a> determine the type of data<a id="874">!</a> contained by a variable<a id="1241">!</a> based on the type of data<a id="875">!</a> being stored there. Such languages are referred to as untyped languages. Each assignment<a id="750">!</a> statement is presumed to be correct. If the variable<a id="1242">!</a> already exists, both its type and value<a id="1210">!</a> are reassigned; if it did not exist before, a new variable<a id="1243">!</a> is created. Exercise 2.2 illustrates the effect of performing simple mathematical operations<a id="1108">!</a> in MATLAB<a id="1043">!</a>. By putting <code>49</code> into the variable<a id="1244">!</a> <code>radius</code>, you established its type as numeric and enabled it to be used in normal arithmetic<a id="746">!</a> operations<a id="1109">!</a>. Character strings<a id="1178">!</a> are specified by including arbitrary characters between single quote marks. These have the type <code>char</code>, and must be handled differently, as discussed fully in Chapter 6. When you stored a character<a id="774">!</a> string in the variable<a id="1245">!</a> radius, adding 1 to it did not cause an error in MATLAB<a id="1044">!</a> as it would in some other languages, because addition is actually defined for<a id="969">!</a> character<a id="775">!</a> strings<a id="1179">!</a>. It just did something radically different &mdash; it actually converted the individual characters to numbers<a id="1096">!</a> and then added <code>1</code>!</p>

			<div class="container">
				<p>While this ability to assign data<a id="876">!</a> types dynamically is good for<a id="970">!</a> interpreted<a id="1014">!</a> languages, it has two undesirable consequences that are really hard to unravel as the program<a id="1127">!</a> runs:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Typographical errors that misspell variable<a id="1246">!</a> names in assignment<a id="751">!</a> statements cause new variables to be declared unintentionally and without the user noticing the error</li>
					<li>Logical errors that assign incompatible data<a id="877">!</a> to the same variable<a id="1247">!</a> can cause obscure runtime<a id="1167">!</a> errors</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Typed languages </strong>require that programmers declare both the name and type of a variable<a id="1248">!</a> before a value<a id="1211">!</a> can be assigned to it. With this information, a compiler can then do a better job of ensuring that the programmer is not using a variable<a id="1249">!</a> in an unintended way. Typed languages fall into two categories: weak<a id="1284">!</a> typing and strong typing. If programmers decide to use only the normal data<a id="878">!</a> types, such as double and char as we saw above, this is known as <strong>weak<a id="1285">!</a> typing </strong>and is the usual approach to typing. In some extreme circumstances, programmers may choose to be more restrictive and define specific data<a id="879">!</a> types with a limited set of permitted interactions. This is called <strong>strong typing</strong>. For example, programmers might define the following data<a id="880">!</a> types, all of which are actually of type double: <code>meters</code>, <code>seconds</code>, and <code>meters_per_second</code>. The compiler would then be provided with a set of rules specifying the legal relationships between these types. For example, assignments can only be made to a variable<a id="1250">!</a> of type <code>meters_per_ second</code> from another variable<a id="1251">!</a> of the same type,<a id="1199">!</a> or by dividing a variable<a id="1252">!</a> of type <code>meters</code> by a variable<a id="1253">!</a> of type <code>seconds</code>. Before rushing to judge on the pickiness of this approach, note that this would have avoided the loss in 1999 of the Mars Climate Orbiter, which crashed into Mars because one group of programmers used English units while<a id="1286">!</a> another used metric.</p>

				<p>This section discusses two different attributes of a variable<a id="1254">!</a>: its type and its value<a id="1212">!</a>. In Section 2.2.2 you saw that a variable<a id="1255">!</a> is a container for<a id="971">!</a> data<a id="881">!</a>, whose value<a id="1213">!</a> is determined by what is assigned to the variable<a id="1256">!</a>. In Section 2.2.3 you saw that by making that assignment<a id="752">!</a> to a variable<a id="1257">!</a>, MATLAB<a id="1045">!</a> also infers the type of data<a id="882">!</a> stored in that variable<a id="1258">!</a>. You will see that while<a id="1287">!</a> MATLAB<a id="1046">!</a> is an untyped language, the programs you write will behave differently if applied to data<a id="883">!</a> of different types. For example, the type <code>double</code> specifies the form and expected behavior of a number. Adding <code>1</code> to a variable<a id="1259">!</a> of class <code>double</code> containing <code>4</code> will, as expected, produce the result <code>5</code>. Similarly, the type <code>char</code> is intended to hold<a id="1008">!</a> a single character<a id="776">!</a>. Adding <code>1</code> to a <code>char</code> variable<a id="1260">!</a> containing the value<a id="1214">!</a> <code>&quot;d&quot;</code> will produce the numerical<a id="1100">!</a> equivalent of the character<a id="777">!</a> <code>&quot;e&quot;</code>. MATLAB<a id="1047">!</a> refers to the type of data<a id="884">!</a> in a variable<a id="1261">!</a> as its class, and the value<a id="1215">!</a> contained in the variable<a id="1262">!</a> at any time as an object, an instance of that class. So in the operation<a id="1106">!</a>:</p>

			<p>MATLAB<a id="1049">!</a> uses several display windows<a id="1292">!</a>. The default view includes a large Command<a id="795">!</a> window and a set of other windows<a id="1293">!</a> showing the files<a id="923">!</a>, variables, and command history. You can customize the window layout by selecting the blue bar on the top of the window and dragging that window. You can even drop one window on top of another so they share screen space as shown in Figs 2.3 and 2.4. If you want to return to the default window layout, select the HOME tab at the top of the screen and pull down Layout-&gt;Default.</p>

				<p>You can use MATLAB<a id="1050">!</a> in two modes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Command<a id="798">!</a> mode, which is useful if you need instant responses to specific MATLAB<a id="1051">!</a> commands, and</li>
					<li>Edit mode, in which practical solutions are developed.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>When working in Command<a id="799">!</a> mode, we use the Command<a id="800">!</a> window, which offers an environment similar to a scientific calculator. This window lets you save any values you calculate, but you cannot permanently save the commands used to generate those values. Figure 2.2 shows how the Command<a id="801">!</a> Window might look after the completion of an exercise similar to Exercise 2.2. The Command<a id="802">!</a> window is useful for<a id="972">!</a> performing quick<a id="1165">!</a> experiments to discover the effects of different commands in MATLAB<a id="1052">!</a> before embedding them in a larger program<a id="1128">!</a>. You can perform calculations in the Command<a id="803">!</a> window much like doing calculations on a scientific calculator. In fact, most of the syntax is even the same. Exercise 2.3 shows how you might use the Command<a id="804">!</a> window to test two simple calculations. Notice that in both of the commands in Exercise 2.3, MATLAB<a id="1053">!</a> echoes the result as if it were saved in a variable<a id="1266">!</a> called <code>ans</code>. This is the default variable<a id="1267">!</a> used to save the result of any calculation you perform in the Command<a id="805">!</a> window that is not specifically assigned to another variable<a id="1268">!</a>. Notice also the use of one of MATLAB<a id="1054">!</a>&rsquo;s many built-in functions, <code>cos(...)</code> that computes the cosine of an angle in radians, and values, in this case<a id="764">!</a>, <code>pi</code>.</p>
				<p>You will see in the next section how to use the Editor<a id="898">!</a> window to create and execute a text<a id="1183">!</a> file of commands as the first step to unleashing the full programming<a id="1158">!</a> capability of the language.</p>

		<h2 id="2_5">2.5 Engineering Example - Spacecraft Launch</h2>
		<div class="container">
			<p>In 1996, the Ansari X Prize was offered for<a id="980">!</a> the first time for<a id="981">!</a> a private venture: a reusable spacecraft. The requirements were for<a id="982">!</a> the same vehicle to carry three people into outer space twice in a two-week time period. The competition was won in 2004 by Tier 1, a company led by Burt Rutan. Their concept was to have a mother ship take off and land on a conventional runway carrying Space Ship One. The spacecraft would be launched at 25,000 feet altitude and would reach outer space (an altitude of 100 km), then glide back and land on the same runway. They repeated this within a week, and they won the prize.</p>
			<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Assuming that the spacecraft uses all its fuel to achieve a vertical velocity <code>u</code> at 25,000 feet, what is the value<a id="1218">!</a> of <code>u</code> for<a id="983">!</a> the spacecraft to reach outer space?</p>
			<p><strong>Solution:</strong> There are two parts to this problem: converting units to the metric system, and choosing and solving an equation for<a id="984">!</a> motion under constant acceleration (the rocket motor is no longer burning).</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Convert the launch altitude from feet to meters. I like to remember as few numbers<a id="1097">!</a> as possible. I do remember that 1 inch = 2.54 cm, so we will use this in a MATLAB<a id="1086">!</a> script to find the conversion from feet to meters. The appropriate chain of calculations is this:</p>
					<p><code>meters = feet X (meters/cm) X (cm/inch) X (inch/feet) </code></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Find and solve the equation. Given the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Initial and final altitudes from which you can compute the distance traveled: <code>s</code></li>
						<li>The motion is under constant acceleration, the force of gravity: <code>g</code></li>
						<li>To just reach outer space, the final velocity, <code>v</code>, is 0</li>
						<li>The initial velocity, <code>u</code>, is needed</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<p>So after some diligent head scratching, we remember the equation of motion under constant acceleration connecting <code>u</code>, <code>v</code>, <code>s</code>, and <code>a</code> is:</p>
					<p><code>v2 = u2 + 2as</code></p>

			<p>However, this is not yet in a useful form. For computers to be able to solve an equation, you need the unknown quantity on the left of the equation and everything known on the right. Since <code>u</code> is the unknown, we move this to the left side of the assignment<a id="755">!</a>, and organize the known quantities to the right. These are the final velocity, <code>v</code> (i.e., 0) the given distance, <code>s</code>, and the acceleration, <code>a</code>. Since the positive direction for<a id="985">!</a> <code>u</code> and <code>s</code> is upward, but gravity is downward, we must use <code>a = -g</code>, and the equation can be transformed to: <code>u = -gs</code> With this information, you can now solve this problem. </p>

<h3>Programming Projects</h3>
<ol>
<li>You are given two sides of a triangle, a = 4.5 and b = 6. The angle between them is 35 degrees. Write a script to find the length of the third side and the area of the triangle.</li>
<li>In the bottom of the ninth inning, the bases are loaded and the Braves are down by three runs. Chipper Jones steps to the plate. Twice he swings and misses. The crowd heads for<a id="991">!</a> the exits. The next pitch is a fast ball down the middle. He swings and makes perfect contact with the ball, sending it up at a 45-degree angle toward the fence 400 ft away.<br>
a.	Write a script to determine how fast he must hit the ball to land at the base of the fence, neglecting the air resistance.<br>
b.	Perform a brief experiment to determine whether there was a better angle at which to hit the ball so that it could clear<a id="782">!</a> a 12 ft fence.</li>
<li>If an ice cream cone is 6 inches tall, and its rim has a diameter of 2 inches, write a script to determine the weight of the ice cream that can fit in the cone, assuming that the ice cream above the cone is a perfect hemisphere. You may neglect the thickness of the cone material. Assume that a gallon of ice cream weighs 8 lb and occupies 7.5 cubic<a id="847">!</a> feet.</li>
<li>Write a script that validates the relationship between sin u, cos u, and tan u by evaluating these functions at suitably chosen values of u.</li>
<li>I like my shower to remain hot for<a id="992">!</a> hours at 100F, but am too cheap to buy one of those on-demand hot water systems. I don't care how slowly the water runs. The water supply is at 50F, and the water heater is rated at 50,000 BTU/hour. Write a script to compute the maximum flow rate of my shower (in cubic<a id="848">!</a> feet per minute) that keeps the water temperature above 100°F.</li>
<li>It takes an average of 45 horsepower to run an electric car at an average speed of 35 mph. Write a script to compute the electrical storage capacity of the battery system that would make this car practical for<a id="993">!</a> a 25-mile commute, recharging the batteries only at home at night when the electricity is cheap. How many D cell<a id="769">!</a> alkaline batteries would be needed for<a id="994">!</a> this?</li>
<li>You want to buy a $300,000 home with 20% down payment. The current compound<a id="843">!</a> interest rate is 4.5%.<br>
a.	Write a script to determine:<br>
<ul>
<li>the monthly payments for<a id="995">!</a> a 30-year loan,</li>
<li>the equivalent simple interest rate,</li>
<li>the total interest paid over the life of the loan.<br>
</ul>
b.	Now, repeat the computation for<a id="996">!</a> a 15-year loan at 5%. Is this a
better deal?
</li>
<li>The distance from my house to my office is 1.5 miles. Every morning, I have to decide whether to take the bus that averages (once it arrives) 25 mph, or to walk. I can walk at 4 mph. Write a script to determine how frequently the buses should run to give them a 50% chance of getting me to the office faster than walking.</li>
<li>A glass has the shape of a truncated cone of height 5 inches. Its top diameter is 3.5 inches, and its base diameter is 2 inches. If water is poured into the glass at 2 gallons per minute, write a script to calculate how long it takes to fill the glass to the brim. One gallon is 7.5 cubic<a id="849">!</a> feet</li>
<li>You can calculate the aerodynamic drag on an object by the formula: <br>

Drag = 1/2 r V**2 Cd <br></li>
<li>The air density, r, is 1.3 kg/m3 and the value<a id="1221">!</a> of the drag area, CdS, is a measure of the resistance of the object as it moves through the air. An object falling through air reaches terminal velocity when the aerodynamic drag equals the object's weight.</li>
<li>sky diver weighing 80 kg has a Cd S value<a id="1222">!</a> of 0.7 when horizontal with arms and legs extended, and 0.15 when head down with arms and legs in line. One diver jumps from a plane at an  altitude of 5,000 m in the horizontal position. After 20 sec, another diver jumps. Write a script to determine how much
time the second diver must spend head down in order to catch<a id="768">!</a> up to the first diver. Also compute the height above the ground where they first meet. For simplicity, you may assume that the sky divers immediately reach their terminal velocity when jumping.</li>
<li>You are given a circle with radius 5 centered at x = 1, y = 2.
You want to calculate the intersection of some lines with that
circle. Write a script to find the x and y coordinates of both
points of intersection. You should test this code<a id="791">!</a> at least with
these lines:<br>

y = 2x - 1<br>
y = -2x - 10<br>
