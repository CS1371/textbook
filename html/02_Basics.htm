	<!-- Introduction -->
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<div class="container">
		<p>The name MATLAB is a contraction of Matrix Laboratory. It was developed for engineers to create, manipulate, and visualize <a id="951"></a>matrices &mdash; rectangular arrays of <a id="956"></a>numerical values. At its most basic level, MATLAB can perform the same <a id="1053"></a>functions as your scientific calculator, but it has expanded far beyond its original capabilities and now provides an interactive system and programming language for many applications, including financial analysis as well as general scientific and technical computation. The following are the fundamental components of MATLAB:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A computing system that accepts one instruction at a time in text form and implements the logic of that instruction. Instructions must conform to a specific syntax and vocabulary, which will be the topic of Chapters 3&ndash;9.</li>
			<li>A large library of modules that provide high-level capabilities for <a id="893"></a>processing data. These modules will be the major topic of Chapters 10&ndash;17.</li>
			<li>A graphical <a id="949"></a>user interface (GUI) that lets users assemble and implement programs that solve specific problems. The rest of this chapter will describe the basic behavior of these <a id="1129"></a>windows.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>MATLAB offers a number of advantages to users over conventional, compiled languages like C++, Java, or F<a id="973"></a><a id="1031"></a>ORTRAN:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Because MATLAB programs are <a id="925"></a>interpreted rather than compiled, the process of producing a working solution can be much quicker than with compiled languages.</li>
			<li>MATLAB excels at <a id="957"></a>numerical calculations, especially <a id="952"></a>matrix calculations.</li>
			<li>MATLAB has built-in graphics capabilities that produce professional-looking <a id="898"></a><a id="1057"></a>images for reports.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>However, the very attributes that make MATLAB convenient for a user to develop <a id="1049"></a>quick solutions to certain problems make it unsuitable for other kinds of projects. For <a id="1022"></a><a id="1043"></a><a id="1124"></a>example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>MATLAB does not work well for large computing projects where a number of developers share coding responsibilities.</li>
			<li>Professional GUIs and windowing applications (like the MATLAB system itself) are best written in a compiled language.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="2_1">2.1 Programming Language Background</h2>
		<div class="container">
			<p>Before learning about concepts in computing, you need to understand the background of <a id="985"></a>programming languages. This section discusses the following aspects of <a id="986"></a>programming languages: abstraction, algorithms, programming <a id="977"></a>paradigms, and three fundamental concepts of programming &mdash; <a id="1091"></a>assigning values to variables, data typing, and the difference between <a id="796"></a>classes and <a id="961"></a>objects.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="chp-subsection" data-sub-num="1" data-sub-name="Abstraction">
			<!-- Abstraction -->
			<h3 id="2_1_1">2.1.1 Abstraction</h3>
			<div class="container">
				<p>For the purpose of this text, we will define abstraction as &ldquo;expressing a quality apart from a particular <a id="989"></a>implementation.&rdquo; We use the concept of abstraction in everyday conversation without thinking about it:</p>
				<p><code>&ldquo;To convert from degrees Celsius to Kelvin, you add 273 to the temperature.&rdquo;</code><br>
				<code>&ldquo;drive home.&rdquo; </code></p>
				<p>The first is an <a id="1023"></a><a id="1044"></a><a id="1125"></a>example of <strong><a id="836"></a>data abstraction</strong>. <code>&ldquo;The temperature&rdquo;</code> could mean a single <a id="911"></a><a id="1061"></a>reading from the thermometer hanging outside the window or a table of temperature readings for the month of August. The specifics are unimportant; the phrase captures all you need to know. The second <a id="1024"></a><a id="1045"></a><a id="1126"></a>example is actually much more complex &mdash; an <a id="1025"></a><a id="1046"></a><a id="1127"></a>example of multiple levels of <strong><a id="982"></a>procedural abstraction</strong>. To a person taking the same route home every night, <code>&ldquo;drive home&rdquo;</code> is all that is required to understand the idea. To a competent driver unfamiliar with the route, the next level of abstraction might be necessary &mdash; turn right out of the parking lot, left onto Main Street, and so on. For instructions to guide a future robotic commuter vehicle, an incredibly fine-grained level of abstraction will be required. Everything taken for granted in the higher level abstractions will need to be meticulously spelled out for the robotic vehicle &mdash; start the engine, accelerate the vehicle, look out for traffic, keep in the lane, find the turn, steer the vehicle, control the speed, observe and obey all signs, and so on.</p>

		<div class="chp-subsection" data-sub-num="2" data-sub-name="Algorithms">
			<!-- Algorithms -->
			<h3 id="2_1_2">2.1.2 Algorithms</h3>
			<div class="container clearfix">
				<div class="float-sm-right card">
					<img src="..\Images\Fig_2_0.JPG" alt="Figure 2.1" class="fig card-image">
					<p class="figure-name card-title">Figure 2.1: Problem Decomposition</p>
				</div>
				<p>Chapter 1 <a id="889"></a>defined <a id="947"></a>problem solving as the ability to isolate sub-problems that seem simple and appropriate to solve, and then assemble the solutions to these sub-problems. The solutions to each of these sub-problems would be expressed as an <b><a id="758"></a><a id="1035"></a>algorithm</b>, which is a sequence of instructions for solving a sub-problem. The process of solving each sub-problem and assembling the solutions to form the solution to the whole problem could also be expressed as an <a id="759"></a><a id="1036"></a>algorithm at a higher level of abstraction.</p>
				<p>The level of abstraction needed to describe an <a id="760"></a><a id="1037"></a>algorithm varies greatly with the mechanism available. For <a id="1026"></a><a id="1047"></a><a id="1128"></a>example, describing the <a id="761"></a><a id="1038"></a>algorithm (recipe) for baking cookies might take the following forms:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>To your grandmother, who has been baking cookies for the last 50 years, it might be <code>&ldquo;Please bake some cookies.&rdquo;</code></li>
					<li>To others it might be <code>&ldquo;Buy a cookie mix and follow the directions.&rdquo;</code></li>
					<li>To a young person learning to cook from scratch, the <a id="762"></a><a id="1039"></a>algorithm might include an intricate series of instructions for <a id="1048"></a>measuring, sifting, and combining ingredients; setting the oven temperature and preheating the oven; forming the cookies and putting them on the cookie sheet; and so on.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In programming terms, algorithms are frequently expressed first conceptually at a high level of abstraction, as illustrated in Figure 2.1. The solutions to each sub-problem would then be expressed at lower and lower levels of abstraction until the description is sufficient to write programs that solve each sub-problem, thereby contributing the pieces that, when assembled, solve the whole problem.</p>

		<div class="chp-subsection" data-sub-num="3" data-sub-name="Programming Paradigms">
			<!-- Programming Paradigms -->
			<h3 id="2_1_3">2.1.3 Programming Paradigms</h3>
			<div class="container">
				<p>From the Greek word <i>paradeigma</i>&mdash;&ldquo;to show alongside&rdquo;&mdash;the American Heritage Dictionary defines a paradigm as &ldquo;a set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality for the community that shares them, especially in an intellectual discipline.&rdquo; So a programming paradigm becomes a codified set of practices allowing the community of computing professionals to frame their ideas. This section considers three radically different <a id="978"></a>paradigms: <a id="878"></a>functional programming, <a id="983"></a>procedural programming, and <a id="959"></a>object-oriented programming.</p>
				<p><b>Functional programming</b> is typically associated with languages like Lisp and Forth, in which every programming <a id="908"></a><a id="942"></a><a id="962"></a>operation is actually implemented as a <a id="875"></a><a id="879"></a>function call with no side effects (changes of state of the program surroundings) permitted or implemented in the language. Without side effects, a programming solution can be mathematically proven to be correct&mdash;an enormous advantage. Except for the discussion of <a id="1001"></a>recursion, this paradigm will not be mentioned again.</p>
				<p><b>Procedural programming</b> is typical of languages like F<a id="974"></a><a id="1032"></a>ORTRAN, C, and MATLAB, where the basic programs or sub-programs are sequences of <a id="965"></a><a id="996"></a>operations on data items that are generally accessible to all programs. Although side effects from sub-programs&mdash;such as changing the values of variables outside that sub-program&mdash;are considered poor practice, they are not prohibited by the language.</p>
				<p><b>Object-oriented programming (OOP)</b>, typical of languages like C++, Ada, and Java, is a relatively new addition to the world of programming <a id="979"></a>paradigms. It is characterized by the concept of encapsulating, or packaging, data items together with the methods or <a id="1054"></a>functions that manipulate those data items. In this paradigm, side effects are explicitly managed by controlling access to the data and methods in a particular grouping. The major theme in <a id="912"></a>true OOP is that &ldquo;everything is an object.&rdquo; You will see MATLAB exhibiting many traits of OOP as you work through this book, but you will not need to use this programming paradigm.</p>

			<!-- Assigning Values to Variables -->
			<h3 id="2_2_2">2.2.2 Assigning Values to Variables</h3>
			<div class="container">
				<p>The concept of <a id="1093"></a>assigning values to variables is the first challenge facing novice programmers. The difficulty arises because many <a id="987"></a>programming languages (including MATLAB) present this simple concept in a syntax that is very similar to conventional algebra, but with significantly different meaning. Consider, for example, the following algebraic expression:</p>
				<p><code>z = x + y</code></p>
				<p>In normal algebra, this is a two-way relationship that is an identity for the duration of the problem. If you knew the values of <code>z</code> and <code>x</code>, you could derive the <a id="1064"></a>value of <code>y</code> with no further analysis. To a programmer, however, this statement has a different meaning. It means that you want to sum the values given to the variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and store the result in a <a id="1080"></a>variable called <code>z</code>. If either <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> is unknown at the time of executing this statement, an error ensues. In particular, this relationship is <a id="913"></a>true only for this statement. The relationship can be revoked in the next instruction, which might be:</p>
				<p><code>z = 4*x - y</code></p>
				<p>In algebra, this pair of statements collectively constrains the values of <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>. In programming, the only significance is that the programmer decided to calculate the current <a id="1065"></a>value of <code>z</code> differently. A few computer languages are sensitive to this dilemma and use a different symbol for <a id="1094"></a>assigning values to a <a id="1081"></a>variable. For example, in Pascal or Ada, an instruction to assign the <a id="1066"></a>value <code>z = x + y</code> would be written as follows: <code>z := x + y</code> The &ldquo;<code>:=</code>&rdquo; operator clearly indicates that this is an <a id="776"></a>assignment statement, not an algebraic identity.</p>
				<p><strong><a id="1074"></a>Variable <a id="1095"></a>names</strong>: In general, <a id="1082"></a>variable <a id="1096"></a>names may contain any combination of uppercase and lowercase alphabetic letters, <a id="953"></a>numbers, and the special characters <code>_</code> (underscore) and <code>$</code> (dollar). The underscore <a id="932"></a>character is frequently used to represent a space in a <a id="1083"></a>variable name because spaces are not allowed. However, <a id="1084"></a>variable <a id="1097"></a>names may not begin with a numeric <a id="933"></a>character, and even though the <a id="1098"></a>names may be hundreds of characters long, the first 64 characters must be unique. Exercise 2.2 demonstrates the <a id="777"></a>assignment of values to variables.</p>

		<div class="chp-subsection" data-sub-num="3" data-sub-name="Data Typing">
			<!-- Data Typing -->

			<div class="container clearfix">
				<div class="card float-sm-right style-points">
			      <p class="card-title">Style Points 2.1</p>
			      <p class="card-text">
							<p ID="250">1. Some early versions of the F<a id="975"></a><a id="1033"></a>ORTRAN and Basic languages severely restricted the number of characters you could use for <a id="1085"></a>variable <a id="1099"></a>names. It is no longer necessary to program as if you were still in the &ldquo;bad old days.&rdquo; Choose <a id="1100"></a>names for variables that describe their content. For example, a <a id="1086"></a>variable used to store the velocity of an object should be named <code>velocity_in_feet_per_second</code> rather than <code>v</code>.</p>
							<p>2. Since the space <a id="934"></a>character is not permitted in <a id="1087"></a>variable <a id="1101"></a>names, there are two conventions for joining multiple words together to make a single <a id="1088"></a>variable name. One uses the underscore <a id="935"></a>character to separate the words (<code>file_<a id="1110"></a>size</code>), and the other capitalizes the first letter of additional words (<code>fileSize</code>).You should choose one convention and be consistent with it. You cannot use a hyphen to concatenate words&mdash;MATLAB treats the name <code>file-<a id="1111"></a>size</code> as the <a id="767"></a><a id="771"></a><a id="1104"></a>arithmetic <a id="909"></a><a id="943"></a><a id="963"></a>operation subtracting the <a id="1067"></a>value of the <a id="1089"></a>variable <code><a id="1112"></a>size</code> from the <a id="1068"></a>value of the variable <code>file</code>.</p>
					</div>
				<p>It is important to understand how MATLAB treats the data stored in a variable. Different languages take varying approaches to this problem, and languages in general fall into two broad categories: untyped and typed. In general, <a id="926"></a>interpreted languages like Lisp, Forth, Python, and MATLAB determine the type of data contained by a variable based on the type of data being stored there. Such languages are referred to as untyped languages. Each <a id="778"></a>assignment statement is presumed to be correct. If the variable already exists, both its type and <a id="1069"></a>value are reassigned; if it did not exist before, a new variable is created. Exercise 2.2 illustrates the effect of performing simple mathematical <a id="966"></a><a id="997"></a>operations in MATLAB. By putting <code>49</code> into the variable <code>radius</code>, you established its type as numeric and enabled it to be used in normal <a id="768"></a><a id="772"></a><a id="1105"></a>arithmetic <a id="967"></a><a id="998"></a>operations. Character strings are specified by including arbitrary characters between single quote marks. These have the type <code>char</code>, and must be handled differently, as discussed fully in Chapter 6. When you stored a <a id="936"></a>character string in the variable radius, adding 1 to it did not cause an error in MATLAB as it would in some other languages, because addition is actually <a id="890"></a>defined for <a id="795"></a><a id="937"></a>character strings. It just did something radically different &mdash; it actually converted the individual characters to <a id="954"></a>numbers and then added <code>1</code>!</p>

			<div class="exercise">#exercise_2_2#</div>
			<div class="container">
				<p>While this ability to assign data <a id="914"></a>types dynamically is good for <a id="927"></a>interpreted languages, it has two undesirable consequences that are really hard to unravel as the program runs:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Typographical errors that misspell variable <a id="1102"></a>names in <a id="779"></a>assignment statements cause new variables to be declared unintentionally and without the user noticing the error</li>
					<li>Logical errors that assign incompatible data to the same variable can cause obscure <a id="1003"></a>runtime errors</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Typed languages </strong>require that programmers declare both the name and type of a variable before a <a id="1070"></a>value can be assigned to it. With this information, a compiler can then do a better job of ensuring that the programmer is not using a variable in an unintended way. Typed languages fall into two categories: <a id="1115"></a>weak typing and strong typing. If programmers decide to use only the normal data <a id="915"></a>types, such as double and char as we saw above, this is known as <strong><a id="1116"></a>weak typing </strong>and is the usual approach to typing. In some extreme circumstances, programmers may choose to be more restrictive and define specific data <a id="916"></a>types with a limited set of permitted interactions. This is called <strong>strong typing</strong>. For example, programmers might define the following data <a id="917"></a>types, all of which are actually of type double: <code>meters</code>, <code>seconds</code>, and <code>meters_per_second</code>. The compiler would then be provided with a set of rules specifying the legal relationships between these <a id="918"></a>types. For example, assignments can only be made to a variable of type <code>meters_per_second</code> from another variable of the same type, or by dividing a variable of type <code>meters</code> by a variable of type <code>seconds</code>. Before rushing to judge on the pickiness of this approach, note that this would have avoided the loss in 1999 of the Mars Climate Orbiter, which crashed into Mars because one group of programmers used English units while another used metric.</p>

			<h3 id="2_2_4">2.2.4 Classes and Objects</h3>
			<div class="container">
				<p>This section discusses two different attributes of a variable: its type and its <a id="1071"></a>value. In Section 2.2.2 you saw that a variable is a container for <a id="980"></a>data, whose <a id="1072"></a>value is determined by what is assigned to the variable. In Section 2.2.3 you saw that by making that <a id="780"></a>assignment to a variable, MATLAB also infers the type of data stored in that variable. You will see that while MATLAB is an untyped language, the programs you write will behave differently if applied to data of different <a id="919"></a>types. For example, the type <code>double</code> specifies the form and expected behavior of a number. Adding <code>1</code> to a variable of class <code>double</code> containing <code>4</code> will, as expected, produce the result <code>5</code>. Similarly, the type <code>char</code> is intended to <a id="882"></a><a id="883"></a><a id="896"></a><a id="897"></a>hold a single <a id="938"></a>character. Adding <code>1</code> to a <code>char</code> variable containing the <a id="1073"></a>value <code>&quot;d&quot;</code> will produce the <a id="958"></a>numerical equivalent of the <a id="939"></a>character <code>&quot;e&quot;</code>. MATLAB refers to the type of data in a variable as its class, and the value contained in the variable at any time as an object, an instance of that class. So in the <a id="910"></a><a id="944"></a><a id="964"></a>operation:</p>
				<p><code>this_number = 42.0</code></p>
				<p>the variable <code>this_number</code> would be <a id="891"></a>defined (if it didn&#39;t already exist); its class would be set to <code>double</code>, the inherent type of a floating point number; and its value to <code>42.0</code>. So the word <code>double</code> corresponds to a type definition or class, while the variable <code>this_number</code> is a variable of that type, which is an instance of that class or, in programming terms, an object.</p>

				<p>You can use MATLAB in two modes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Command mode, which is useful if you need instant responses to specific MATLAB commands, and</li>
					<li>Edit mode, in which practical solutions are developed.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>When working in Command mode, we use the Command window, which offers an environment similar to a scientific calculator. This window lets you <a id="1004"></a>save any values you calculate, but you cannot permanently <a id="1005"></a>save the commands used to generate those values. Figure 2.2 shows how the <a id="817"></a><a id="1150"></a>Command Window might look after the completion of an exercise similar to Exercise 2.2. The Command window is useful for performing <a id="1050"></a>quick experiments to discover the effects of different commands in MATLAB before embedding them in a larger program. You can perform calculations in the Command window much like doing calculations on a scientific calculator. In fact, most of the syntax is even the same. Exercise 2.3 shows how you might use the Command window to test two simple calculations. Notice that in both of the commands in Exercise 2.3, MATLAB echoes the result as if it were saved in a variable called <code>ans</code>. This is the default variable used to <a id="1006"></a>save the result of any calculation you perform in the Command window that is not specifically assigned to another variable. Notice also the use of one of MATLAB&rsquo;s many built-in <a id="1055"></a>functions, <code>cos(...)</code> that computes the cosine of an angle in radians, and values, in this <a id="790"></a>case, <code>pi</code>.</p>

By default, the columns in the window display the name of the variable and its current value. You can customize the columns by right-clicking the menu bar containing &quot;Name.&quot; In Figure 2.3, we have added columns for the <a id="1113"></a>size of the variables, the number of bytes occupied in memory and the data type, or class. In this <a id="791"></a>case, we are seeing the workspace that results from Exercise 2.2. Notice that in addition to the &quot;class&quot; column, the icon to the left of the variable name symbolizes the data type of the variables. We see that the variable <code>label</code> is a 1 &times; 18 <a id="769"></a>array, uses 36 bytes of memory, and is an object of class char. We will discuss strings in a later chapter.</p>
				<p>You can recall the values for any variable by typing the variable name in the Command window.

				<p>When MATLAB accesses files from and saves information to your hard drive, it uses the current directory shown on the tool bar above the Command window. The default for the current directory depends on your version of the software and how it was installed. This can be changed by selecting another directory from the drop-down list to the right of the current directory name, or by browsing through your computer files using the browse button located to the right of the drop-down list.</p>
				<p>Like the <a id="1170"></a><a id="1181"></a>Workspace Window, the <a id="1154"></a>Current Folder window can be customized. By right-clicking the white bar containing &quot;Name&quot;, you can select columns for the <a id="1114"></a>size, date modified, type or description of the file. The first three add columns to the display. If the file is a .m file the Description selection (shown in Fig 2.4) adds a row below the file basic information indicating the purpose of the file. In this <a id="792"></a>case, we have a file that implements the my_cylinder <a id="876"></a><a id="880"></a>function and a script to test that <a id="877"></a><a id="881"></a>function.

				<p>MATLAB uses text files as a permanent means of saving <a id="1018"></a>scripts (sets of instructions) rather than just entering commands in the Command window. As you will see in Chapter 8, text files are streams of characters stored sequentially with &ldquo;markers&rdquo; that indicate the <a id="845"></a><a id="854"></a>end of each line of text. For now, think of a script much like <a id="920"></a><a id="1062"></a>writing an e-mail message &mdash; a number of lines of text written in a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; editor.

				<p>A MATLAB script consists of a combination of executable instructions that MATLAB interprets and comment statements that <a id="895"></a>help readers understand the script. You create <a id="819"></a>comments by putting a percent sign (%) in the text file. MATLAB will ignore all text from that mark to the <a id="846"></a><a id="855"></a>end of the current line. The MATLAB Editor colors all such <a id="820"></a>comments green to distinguish them from the executable instructions. Most applications that use files specify a particular file name extension ( the characters after the period in the file name) to identify how the text files will be used. MATLAB uses the extension .m, and the script files are often referred to as m-files. You create a new script file either by choosing File &gt; New &gt; M-File or by clicking the new file icon on the far left of the tool bar. The MATLAB Editor will then open a blank file in which you can enter commands and <a id="821"></a>comments. Try <a id="888"></a><a id="1107"></a>creating the script described in Exercise 2.3.</p>

				<p>After you have entered a script, you must name it and <a id="1010"></a>save it in a directory. MATLAB will need to find that directory &mdash; its working directory &mdash; in order to run the script. By default, MATLAB expects <a id="1019"></a>scripts to be stored in the working directory, displayed in the tool bar at the top of the MATLAB main window. The specific path will vary with your version of MATLAB. However, the <a id="830"></a>Current Directory window always shows the default location when MATLAB starts. If you decide to store your <a id="1020"></a>scripts elsewhere, you will need to redirect MATLAB to that directory by typing it into the <a id="831"></a>Current Directory window or using the browse button to the right of the display. Once script files are saved in your working directory, you can edit them again by selecting and <a id="930"></a>opening them with the MATLAB Editor. To open them, either use the open menu command or double-click the file name in the <a id="832"></a>Current Directory window.

		<h2 id="2_5">2.5 Engineering Example - Spacecraft Launch</h2>
		<div class="container">
			<p>In 1996, the Ansari X Prize was offered for the first time for a private venture: a reusable <a id="866"></a>spacecraft. The requirements were for the same vehicle to carry three people into outer space twice in a two-week time period. The competition was won in 2004 by Tier 1, a company led by Burt Rutan. Their concept was to have a mother ship take off and land on a conventional runway carrying Space Ship One. The <a id="867"></a>spacecraft would be launched at 25,000 feet altitude and would reach outer space (an altitude of 100 km), then glide back and land on the same runway. They repeated this within a week, and they won the prize.</p>
			<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Assuming that the <a id="868"></a>spacecraft uses all its fuel to achieve a vertical velocity <code>u</code> at 25,000 feet, what is the value of <code>u</code> for the <a id="869"></a>spacecraft to reach outer space?</p>
			<p><strong>Solution:</strong> There are two parts to this problem: converting units to the metric system, and choosing and solving an equation for motion under constant acceleration (the rocket motor is no longer burning).</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Convert the launch altitude from feet to meters. I like to remember as few <a id="955"></a>numbers as possible. I do remember that 1 inch = 2.54 cm, so we will use this in a MATLAB script to find the conversion from feet to meters. The appropriate chain of calculations is this:</p>
					<p><code>meters = feet X (meters/cm) X (cm/inch) X (inch/feet) </code></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Find and solve the equation. Given the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Initial and final altitudes from which you can compute the distance traveled: <code>s</code></li>
						<li>The motion is under constant acceleration, the force of gravity: <code>g</code></li>
						<li>To just reach outer space, the final velocity, <code>v</code>, is 0</li>
						<li>The initial velocity, <code>u</code>, is needed</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<p>So after some diligent head scratching, we remember the equation of motion under constant acceleration connecting <code>u</code>, <code>v</code>, <code>s</code>, and <code>a</code> is:</p>
					<p><code>v2 = u2 + 2as</code></p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>However, this is not yet in a useful form. For computers to be able to solve an equation, you need the unknown quantity on the left of the equation and everything known on the right. Since <code>u</code> is the unknown, we move this to the left side of the <a id="783"></a>assignment, and organize the known quantities to the right. These are the final velocity, <code>v</code> (i.e., 0) the given distance, <code>s</code>, and the acceleration, <code>a</code>. Since the positive direction for <code>u</code> and <code>s</code> is upward, but gravity is downward, we must use <code>a = -g</code>, and the equation can be transformed to: <code>u = -gs</code> With this information, you can now solve this problem. </p>
			<p>Listing 2.2 show the author's version of a script to perform  this calculation. Although most modern computing environments, including MATLAB, have tools that actually solve symbolic equations, these tools are not appropriate for an <a id="946"></a>introduction to programming and will not be discussed in this book.</p>

<h3>Programming Projects</h3>

<li>You are given two sides of a triangle, a = 4.5 and b = 6. The angle between them is 35 degrees. Write a script to find the length of the third side and the area of the triangle.</li>
<li>In the bottom of the ninth inning, the bases are loaded and the Braves are down by three runs. Chipper Jones steps to the plate. Twice he swings and misses. The crowd heads for the exits. The next pitch is a fast ball down the middle. He swings and makes perfect contact with the ball, sending it up at a 45-degree angle toward the fence 400 ft away.<br>
a.	Write a script to determine how fast he must hit the ball to land at the base of the fence, neglecting the air resistance.<br>
b.	Perform a brief experiment to determine whether there was a better angle at which to hit the ball so that it could <a id="798"></a>clear a 12 ft fence.</li>
<li>If an ice cream cone is 6 inches tall, and its rim has a diameter of 2 inches, write a script to determine the weight of the ice cream that can fit in the cone, assuming that the ice cream above the cone is a perfect hemisphere. You may neglect the thickness of the cone material. Assume that a gallon of ice cream weighs 8 lb and occupies 7.5 <a id="825"></a><a id="922"></a>cubic feet.</li>
<li>Write a script that validates the relationship between sin u, cos u, and tan u by evaluating these functions at suitably chosen values of u.</li>
<li>I like my shower to remain hot for hours at 100F, but am too cheap to buy one of those on-demand hot water systems. I don't care how slowly the water runs. The water supply is at 50F, and the water heater is rated at 50,000 BTU/hour. Write a script to compute the maximum flow rate of my shower (in <a id="826"></a><a id="923"></a>cubic feet per minute) that keeps the water temperature above 100°F.</li>
<li>It takes an average of 45 horsepower to run an electric car at an average speed of 35 mph. Write a script to compute the <a id="863"></a><a id="871"></a>electrical storage capacity of the battery system that would make this car practical for a 25-mile commute, recharging the batteries only at home at night when the electricity is cheap. How many D <a id="773"></a>cell alkaline batteries would be needed for this?</li>
<li>You want to buy a $300,000 home with 20% down payment. The current <a id="1059"></a>compound interest rate is 4.5%.<br>
a.	Write a script to determine:<br>
<ul>
<li>the monthly payments for a 30-year loan,</li>
<li>the equivalent simple interest rate,</li>
<li>the total interest paid over the life of the loan.<br>
</ul>
b.	Now, repeat the computation for a 15-year loan at 5%. Is this a
better deal?
</li>
<li>The distance from my house to my office is 1.5 miles. Every morning, I have to decide whether to take the bus that averages (once it arrives) 25 mph, or to walk. I can walk at 4 mph. Write a script to determine how frequently the buses should run to give them a 50% chance of getting me to the office faster than walking.</li>
<li>A glass has the shape of a truncated cone of height 5 inches. Its top diameter is 3.5 inches, and its base diameter is 2 inches. If water is poured into the glass at 2 gallons per minute, write a script to calculate how long it takes to fill the glass to the brim. One gallon is 7.5 <a id="827"></a><a id="924"></a>cubic feet</li>
<li>You can calculate the aerodynamic drag on an object by the formula: <br>

Drag = 1/2 r V<sup>2</sup> Cd <br></li>
<li>The air density, r, is 1.3 kg/m3 and the value of the drag area, CdS, is a measure of the resistance of the object as it moves through the air. An object falling through air reaches terminal velocity when the aerodynamic drag equals the object's weight.</li>
<li>sky diver weighing 80 kg has a Cd S value of 0.7 when horizontal with arms and legs extended, and 0.15 when head down with arms and legs in line. One diver jumps from a plane at an  altitude of 5,000 m in the horizontal position. After 20 sec, another diver jumps. Write a script to determine how much
time the second diver must spend head down in order to <a id="794"></a>catch up to the first diver. Also compute the height above the ground where they first meet. For simplicity, you may assume that the sky divers immediately reach their terminal velocity when jumping.</li>
<li>You are given a circle with radius 5 centered at x = 1, y = 2.
You want to calculate the intersection of some lines with that
circle. Write a script to find the x and y coordinates of both
points of intersection. You should test this code at least with
these lines:<br>

y = 2x - 1<br>
y = -2x - 10<br>
